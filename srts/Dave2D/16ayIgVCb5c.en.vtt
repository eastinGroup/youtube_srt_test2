see the i it's an intel chip
this<00:03:35.120><c> was</c><00:03:35.599><c> also</c><00:03:35.920><c> expensive</c><00:03:36.400><c> because</c><00:03:36.640><c> it's</c>

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
this was also expensive because it's

that was heavily tweaked for this year
 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.309 align:start position:0%
that was heavily tweaked for this year
like<00:07:38.639><c> full-blown</c><00:07:39.199><c> rgb</c><00:07:39.680><c> system</c><00:07:40.000><c> if</c><00:07:40.080><c> you're</c>

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
like full-blown rgb system if you're
 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.990 align:start position:0%
like full-blown rgb system if you're
into<00:07:40.560><c> that</c><00:07:40.960><c> but</c><00:07:41.120><c> they</c><00:07:41.280><c> just</c><00:07:41.440><c> made</c><00:07:41.599><c> a</c><00:07:41.680><c> much</c>

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
into that but they just made a much
 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.629 align:start position:0%
into that but they just made a much
better

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
better
 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
better
thinner<00:07:43.039><c> lighter</c><00:07:43.360><c> product</c><00:07:43.599><c> than</c><00:07:43.680><c> they</c><00:07:43.759><c> had</c><00:07:43.919><c> in</c>

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
thinner lighter product than they had in

but<00:10:42.720><c> the</c><00:10:42.880><c> one</c><00:10:43.120><c> thing</c><00:10:43.279><c> i</c><00:10:43.360><c> think</c><00:10:43.600><c> that</c><00:10:43.680><c> they</c><00:10:43.839><c> do</c>

00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
but the one thing i think that they do
 

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:45.910 align:start position:0%
but the one thing i think that they do
really<00:10:44.399><c> well</c><00:10:44.880><c> is</c><00:10:45.040><c> that</c><00:10:45.120><c> they</c><00:10:45.279><c> make</c><00:10:45.519><c> a</c><00:10:45.600><c> device</c>

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
really well is that they make a device
 

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.269 align:start position:0%
really well is that they make a device

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
that takes acoustics
 

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.710 align:start position:0%
that takes acoustics

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%

yeah it's an eight here and i would
 

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:09.430 align:start position:0%
yeah it's an eight here and i would
consider

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
consider
 

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.430 align:start position:0%
consider
using<00:18:09.840><c> this</c><00:18:10.080><c> thing</c><00:18:10.400><c> like</c><00:18:10.720><c> if</c><00:18:10.880><c> it</c><00:18:11.039><c> had</c><00:18:11.200><c> more</c>

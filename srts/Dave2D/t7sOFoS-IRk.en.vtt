00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
similar to last year's model i just kind
 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.549 align:start position:0%
similar to last year's model i just kind
of<00:00:12.960><c> went</c><00:00:13.200><c> under</c><00:00:13.360><c> the</c><00:00:13.440><c> radar</c><00:00:13.840><c> for</c><00:00:14.000><c> me</c>

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
of went under the radar for me
 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.630 align:start position:0%
of went under the radar for me
uh<00:00:14.880><c> but</c><00:00:15.120><c> having</c><00:00:15.440><c> gotten</c><00:00:15.839><c> it</c><00:00:15.920><c> in</c><00:00:16.160><c> i</c><00:00:16.240><c> realized</c>

uh but having gotten it in i realized
 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
uh but having gotten it in i realized

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
changed under the hood
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.269 align:start position:0%
changed under the hood
and<00:00:19.680><c> we'll</c><00:00:19.920><c> talk</c><00:00:20.160><c> about</c><00:00:20.320><c> them</c><00:00:20.560><c> now</c><00:00:20.800><c> my</c><00:00:21.039><c> story</c>

the best thing out there right i felt
like

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.950 align:start position:0%
like
it<00:00:35.120><c> wasn't</c><00:00:35.600><c> super</c><00:00:35.920><c> competitive</c><00:00:36.559><c> in</c><00:00:36.640><c> terms</c><00:00:36.880><c> of</c>

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
it wasn't super competitive in terms of
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.470 align:start position:0%
it wasn't super competitive in terms of
just<00:00:37.200><c> best</c><00:00:37.520><c> performance</c>

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
just best performance
 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.229 align:start position:0%
just best performance

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
stuff that's more advanced so i just
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.310 align:start position:0%
stuff that's more advanced so i just
never<00:00:44.879><c> really</c><00:00:45.120><c> recommended</c><00:00:45.600><c> this</c><00:00:45.760><c> thing</c>

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 align:start position:0%

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
openly from last year's model it did
 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.150 align:start position:0%
openly from last year's model it did
look<00:00:49.280><c> really</c><00:00:49.520><c> good</c><00:00:49.680><c> though</c>

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
look really good though
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 align:start position:0%

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
year uh let's start off with the
 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.470 align:start position:0%
year uh let's start off with the
exterior

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
exterior
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
exterior
this<00:00:54.640><c> wasn't</c><00:00:54.960><c> the</c><00:00:55.039><c> problem</c><00:00:55.360><c> with</c><00:00:55.520><c> last</c><00:00:55.680><c> year's</c>

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
this wasn't the problem with last year's
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
this wasn't the problem with last year's
model<00:00:56.079><c> but</c><00:00:56.239><c> they've</c><00:00:56.399><c> actually</c><00:00:56.640><c> changed</c><00:00:56.960><c> it</c>

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
model but they've actually changed it
 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.630 align:start position:0%
model but they've actually changed it
this<00:00:57.920><c> is</c><00:00:58.239><c> now</c><00:00:58.800><c> a</c><00:00:59.920><c> smooth</c><00:01:00.320><c> like</c>

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
this is now a smooth like
 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.869 align:start position:0%
this is now a smooth like
hard<00:01:00.960><c> finish</c><00:01:01.680><c> last</c><00:01:01.920><c> year's</c><00:01:02.160><c> model</c><00:01:02.399><c> had</c><00:01:02.559><c> like</c><00:01:02.719><c> a</c>

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 align:start position:0%
hard finish last year's model had like a
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 align:start position:0%
hard finish last year's model had like a
soft<00:01:03.120><c> touch</c><00:01:03.440><c> finish</c><00:01:03.680><c> to</c><00:01:03.840><c> it</c><00:01:04.000><c> i</c><00:01:04.080><c> really</c><00:01:04.320><c> like</c>

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
soft touch finish to it i really like
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.230 align:start position:0%
soft touch finish to it i really like
this<00:01:04.720><c> material</c><00:01:05.040><c> but</c><00:01:05.199><c> my</c><00:01:05.439><c> impression</c>

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
this material but my impression
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.750 align:start position:0%
this material but my impression
was<00:01:06.400><c> that</c><00:01:06.640><c> this</c><00:01:06.799><c> was</c><00:01:06.960><c> something</c><00:01:07.360><c> that</c><00:01:07.520><c> could</c>

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
was that this was something that could
 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.310 align:start position:0%
was that this was something that could
get<00:01:08.000><c> dirty</c><00:01:08.799><c> easily</c><00:01:09.200><c> like</c><00:01:09.439><c> if</c><00:01:09.600><c> you</c><00:01:09.680><c> had</c>

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 align:start position:0%

i think they tweaked the hinge tension
just<00:02:43.040><c> a</c><00:02:43.120><c> little</c><00:02:43.280><c> bit</c>

here's<00:03:19.360><c> my</c><00:03:19.599><c> take</c><00:03:19.840><c> on</c><00:03:19.920><c> them</c><00:03:20.080><c> though</c><00:03:20.640><c> they</c><00:03:20.879><c> sound</c>

here's my take on them though they sound
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.790 align:start position:0%
here's my take on them though they sound

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
better than the r2s
 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.470 align:start position:0%
better than the r2s
but<00:03:22.959><c> they</c><00:03:23.120><c> don't</c><00:03:23.360><c> sound</c><00:03:23.760><c> amazing</c><00:03:24.159><c> like</c><00:03:24.319><c> they</c>

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
but they don't sound amazing like they
 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.070 align:start position:0%
but they don't sound amazing like they
certainly<00:03:24.799><c> don't</c><00:03:24.959><c> sound</c><00:03:25.280><c> as</c><00:03:25.440><c> good</c><00:03:25.760><c> as</c><00:03:25.920><c> let's</c>

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
certainly don't sound as good as let's
 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.430 align:start position:0%
certainly don't sound as good as let's
say<00:03:26.239><c> like</c><00:03:26.480><c> macbook</c><00:03:26.879><c> speakers</c>

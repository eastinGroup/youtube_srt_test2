so if we talk about one to two part I
know<00:03:19.530><c> there</c><00:03:19.950><c> are</c><00:03:20.130><c> different</c><00:03:20.730><c> hacks</c><00:03:21.030><c> for</c>

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 align:start position:0%
know there are different hacks for
 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.229 align:start position:0%
know there are different hacks for

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
certain tasks because there is for
 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.670 align:start position:0%
certain tasks because there is for

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
example there is a test that you can you
 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.949 align:start position:0%
example there is a test that you can you
know<00:03:25.800><c> spend</c><00:03:26.220><c> thirty</c><00:03:26.760><c> minutes</c><00:03:27.090><c> on</c><00:03:27.269><c> but</c><00:03:27.720><c> then</c>

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 align:start position:0%
know spend thirty minutes on but then
 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.380 align:start position:0%
know spend thirty minutes on but then
find<00:03:28.350><c> out</c><00:03:28.530><c> a</c><00:03:28.560><c> way</c><00:03:28.830><c> to</c><00:03:28.890><c> welcome</c><00:03:29.400><c> two</c><00:03:29.970><c> minute</c><00:03:30.269><c> the</c>

find out a way to welcome two minute the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 align:start position:0%
main hack is never ever do that you
 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
main hack is never ever do that you
can't<00:03:33.690><c> solve</c><00:03:34.050><c> a</c><00:03:34.290><c> problem</c><00:03:34.769><c> in</c><00:03:35.010><c> three</c><00:03:35.790><c> minutes</c>

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 align:start position:0%
can't solve a problem in three minutes
 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.660 align:start position:0%
can't solve a problem in three minutes
tops<00:03:36.750><c> don't</c><00:03:37.650><c> solve</c><00:03:37.950><c> it</c><00:03:38.130><c> at</c><00:03:38.250><c> all</c>

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 align:start position:0%
tops don't solve it at all
 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
tops don't solve it at all
you<00:03:38.820><c> drop</c><00:03:39.060><c> it</c><00:03:39.239><c> like</c><00:03:39.360><c> a</c><00:03:39.420><c> hot</c><00:03:39.690><c> plate</c><00:03:39.989><c> yeah</c><00:03:40.620><c> it's</c>

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 align:start position:0%
you drop it like a hot plate yeah it's
 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.750 align:start position:0%
you drop it like a hot plate yeah it's
good<00:03:41.070><c> it's</c><00:03:41.130><c> the</c><00:03:41.640><c> surest</c><00:03:42.090><c> way</c><00:03:42.570><c> to</c><00:03:43.430><c> get</c><00:03:44.430><c> the</c><00:03:44.610><c> lows</c>

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
good it's the surest way to get the lows
 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
good it's the surest way to get the lows
or<00:03:45.150><c> expanding</c><00:03:45.989><c> is</c><00:03:46.080><c> what</c><00:03:46.260><c> I</c><00:03:46.500><c> would</c><00:03:46.560><c> like</c><00:03:46.739><c> to</c>

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 align:start position:0%
or expanding is what I would like to
 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.729 align:start position:0%
or expanding is what I would like to
finish<00:03:47.970><c> every</c><00:03:48.420><c> single</c><00:03:48.810><c> question</c><00:03:49.110><c> otherwise</c>

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
finish every single question otherwise
 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
finish every single question otherwise
you<00:03:50.160><c> would</c><00:03:50.370><c> you</c><00:03:50.580><c> get</c><00:03:50.760><c> a</c><00:03:50.790><c> huge</c><00:03:51.239><c> mountain</c><00:03:51.750><c> yeah</c>

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 align:start position:0%
you would you get a huge mountain yeah
 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.229 align:start position:0%
you would you get a huge mountain yeah
so<00:03:53.239><c> it's</c><00:03:54.239><c> it</c><00:03:54.510><c> a</c><00:03:55.340><c> Pyrrhic</c><00:03:56.340><c> victory</c><00:03:56.700><c> to</c><00:03:56.820><c> solve</c><00:03:57.120><c> a</c>

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
so it's it a Pyrrhic victory to solve a
 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
so it's it a Pyrrhic victory to solve a
problem<00:03:57.390><c> even</c><00:03:57.870><c> correctly</c><00:03:58.350><c> in</c><00:03:58.470><c> five</c><00:03:58.650><c> minutes</c>

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 align:start position:0%
problem even correctly in five minutes
 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
problem even correctly in five minutes
so<00:03:59.180><c> the</c><00:04:00.180><c> main</c><00:04:00.360><c> thing</c><00:04:00.660><c> is</c><00:04:00.810><c> not</c><00:04:00.840><c> to</c><00:04:01.200><c> do</c><00:04:01.320><c> that</c><00:04:01.530><c> so</c>

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 align:start position:0%
so the main thing is not to do that so
 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.490 align:start position:0%
so the main thing is not to do that so
do<00:04:02.130><c> you</c><00:04:02.250><c> teach</c><00:04:02.580><c> those</c><00:04:02.970><c> hacks</c><00:04:03.269><c> I</c><00:04:03.570><c> was</c><00:04:04.350><c> always</c>

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
do you teach those hacks I was always

looking for breast locks can tell me all
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.630 align:start position:0%
looking for breast locks can tell me all

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
the hacks for all of those shame it is
 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.900 align:start position:0%
the hacks for all of those shame it is
no<00:04:08.940><c> member</c><00:04:09.239><c> brad.leah</c><00:04:09.870><c> room</c>

yeah but so you do right open no I
 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
yeah but so you do right open no I
thought<00:04:13.910><c> you</c><00:04:14.180><c> do</c><00:04:14.680><c> without</c><00:04:15.680><c> that</c><00:04:16.070><c> teaching</c><00:04:16.610><c> the</c>

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 align:start position:0%
thought you do without that teaching the
 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.580 align:start position:0%
thought you do without that teaching the
GMAT<00:04:17.060><c> it's</c><00:04:17.180><c> pointless</c><00:04:17.540><c> I</c><00:04:17.900><c> mean</c><00:04:18.290><c> there</c><00:04:18.470><c> is</c>

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 align:start position:0%
GMAT it's pointless I mean there is
 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
GMAT it's pointless I mean there is
content<00:04:19.100><c> and</c><00:04:19.190><c> of</c><00:04:19.340><c> course</c><00:04:19.610><c> I</c><00:04:19.790><c> also</c><00:04:19.940><c> teach</c><00:04:20.269><c> that</c>

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 align:start position:0%
content and of course I also teach that
 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.810 align:start position:0%
content and of course I also teach that
but<00:04:20.810><c> in</c><00:04:20.930><c> addition</c><00:04:21.049><c> to</c><00:04:21.440><c> that</c><00:04:21.590><c> you</c><00:04:22.070><c> have</c><00:04:22.100><c> to</c><00:04:22.310><c> have</c>

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 align:start position:0%
but in addition to that you have to have
 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.940 align:start position:0%
but in addition to that you have to have
test<00:04:23.150><c> strategy</c><00:04:23.750><c> you</c><00:04:23.870><c> have</c><00:04:23.930><c> to</c><00:04:24.170><c> know</c><00:04:24.350><c> which</c>

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 align:start position:0%
test strategy you have to know which
 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%

it's<00:07:12.620><c> harder</c><00:07:13.190><c> because</c><00:07:13.400><c> first</c><00:07:14.390><c> of</c><00:07:14.510><c> all</c><00:07:14.600><c> it's</c>

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 align:start position:0%
it's harder because first of all it's
 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's harder because first of all it's

not your native language obviously and
 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.860 align:start position:0%
not your native language obviously and

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 align:start position:0%

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 align:start position:0%
speakers right yes right and also it
 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.870 align:start position:0%
speakers right yes right and also it
it's<00:07:25.310><c> hard</c><00:07:25.700><c> because</c><00:07:26.000><c> uh</c><00:07:27.220><c> in</c><00:07:28.220><c> math</c><00:07:28.520><c> know</c><00:07:28.820><c> you</c>

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's hard because uh in math know you
 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's hard because uh in math know you

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
can solve the problem and it's very

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.250 align:start position:0%

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.480 align:start position:0%

on<00:07:34.789><c> verbal</c><00:07:35.270><c> sometimes</c><00:07:36.110><c> it's</c><00:07:36.350><c> very</c><00:07:36.410><c> fuzzy</c><00:07:36.800><c> yeah</c>

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490 align:start position:0%
on verbal sometimes it's very fuzzy yeah
 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.810 align:start position:0%
on verbal sometimes it's very fuzzy yeah
and<00:07:37.729><c> the</c><00:07:38.510><c> lower</c><00:07:38.780><c> your</c><00:07:39.050><c> level</c><00:07:39.410><c> is</c><00:07:39.590><c> the</c><00:07:40.220><c> fuzzier</c>

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.820 align:start position:0%
and the lower your level is the fuzzier
 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
and the lower your level is the fuzzier
it<00:07:41.030><c> is</c><00:07:41.330><c> so</c><00:07:41.630><c> then</c><00:07:41.870><c> the</c><00:07:42.200><c> more</c><00:07:42.470><c> you</c><00:07:42.590><c> study</c><00:07:42.860><c> and</c><00:07:43.520><c> the</c>

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:44.330 align:start position:0%
it is so then the more you study and the
 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.870 align:start position:0%
it is so then the more you study and the
more<00:07:44.600><c> you</c><00:07:44.720><c> learn</c><00:07:44.930><c> the</c><00:07:45.289><c> clearer</c><00:07:46.220><c> and</c><00:07:46.580><c> the</c><00:07:46.610><c> more</c>

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
more you learn the clearer and the more
 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.570 align:start position:0%
more you learn the clearer and the more

and once I took it I realized quantitive
was<00:02:22.280><c> the</c><00:02:22.430><c> worst</c><00:02:22.610><c> part</c><00:02:22.970><c> for</c><00:02:23.030><c> me</c><00:02:23.209><c> so</c><00:02:23.540><c> the</c><00:02:24.170><c> thing</c><00:02:24.440><c> I</c>

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 align:start position:0%
was the worst part for me so the thing I
 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.699 align:start position:0%
was the worst part for me so the thing I
did<00:02:24.800><c> so</c><00:02:25.640><c> the</c><00:02:25.760><c> next</c><00:02:25.790><c> day</c><00:02:26.239><c> I</c><00:02:26.510><c> just</c><00:02:27.170><c> open</c><00:02:27.560><c> the</c>

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 align:start position:0%
did so the next day I just open the

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
the course but I think those first 25%
are<00:06:08.289><c> the</c><00:06:08.949><c> best</c><00:06:09.219><c> because</c><00:06:09.729><c> you</c><00:06:10.239><c> know</c><00:06:10.389><c> they</c><00:06:10.629><c> want</c>

you<00:11:31.939><c> know</c><00:11:31.970><c> that</c><00:11:32.569><c> this</c><00:11:32.839><c> is</c><00:11:32.989><c> not</c><00:11:33.139><c> see</c><00:11:33.349><c> this</c><00:11:33.559><c> is</c>

00:11:33.669 --> 00:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know that this is not see this is

you know that this is not see this is

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:35.329 align:start position:0%
not B this is not a and you just have to
 

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:38.229 align:start position:0%
not B this is not a and you just have to
decide<00:11:35.749><c> between</c><00:11:35.899><c> D</c><00:11:36.229><c> and</c><00:11:36.259><c> E</c><00:11:36.559><c> and</c><00:11:37.029><c> visually</c><00:11:38.029><c> it's</c>

00:11:38.229 --> 00:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
decide between D and E and visually it's
 

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.419 align:start position:0%
decide between D and E and visually it's
easier<00:11:38.629><c> so</c><00:11:38.899><c> do</c><00:11:39.229><c> that</c><00:11:39.409><c> with</c><00:11:39.709><c> the</c><00:11:39.799><c> template</c><00:11:40.220><c> and</c>

00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:40.429 align:start position:0%
easier so do that with the template and
 

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:45.819 align:start position:0%
easier so do that with the template and
I<00:11:41.389><c> think</c><00:11:41.749><c> the</c><00:11:42.019><c> last</c><00:11:42.459><c> the</c><00:11:43.459><c> egg</c><00:11:43.639><c> thing</c><00:11:44.179><c> whoa</c><00:11:45.169><c> I</c>

I think the last the egg thing whoa I
 

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
I think the last the egg thing whoa I
wanted<00:11:46.579><c> to</c><00:11:46.699><c> tell</c><00:11:46.909><c> you</c><00:11:47.119><c> it's</c><00:11:47.359><c> about</c><00:11:47.839><c> our</c>

00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:52.939 align:start position:0%

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:04.970 align:start position:0%
take that test and especially on the
 

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.649 align:start position:0%
take that test and especially on the
first<00:12:05.599><c> test</c><00:12:05.959><c> I</c><00:12:06.229><c> goat</c><00:12:06.439><c> 640</c><00:12:07.369><c> on</c><00:12:07.759><c> the</c><00:12:07.970><c> second</c><00:12:08.299><c> test</c>

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:08.659 align:start position:0%
first test I goat 640 on the second test
 

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:12.690 align:start position:0%
first test I goat 640 on the second test
I<00:12:08.720><c> got</c><00:12:10.029><c> 670</c><00:12:11.029><c> on</c><00:12:11.299><c> the</c><00:12:11.720><c> third</c><00:12:11.959><c> test</c><00:12:12.259><c> I</c><00:12:12.409><c> go</c>

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:12.700 align:start position:0%
I got 670 on the third test I go
 

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
I got 670 on the third test I go
700<00:12:13.300><c> and</c><00:12:13.480><c> I</c><00:12:13.510><c> was</c><00:12:13.660><c> so</c><00:12:13.900><c> excited</c><00:12:14.080><c> but</c><00:12:14.950><c> then</c><00:12:15.220><c> I</c><00:12:15.460><c> took</c>

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:15.730 align:start position:0%
700 and I was so excited but then I took
 

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
700 and I was so excited but then I took
another<00:12:16.000><c> practice</c><00:12:16.510><c> test</c><00:12:16.540><c> and</c><00:12:16.960><c> his</c><00:12:17.080><c> score</c><00:12:17.320><c> is</c>

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:17.730 align:start position:0%
another practice test and his score is
 

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.950 align:start position:0%
another practice test and his score is
650<00:12:18.730><c> so</c><00:12:19.420><c> don't</c><00:12:19.930><c> take</c><00:12:20.530><c> them</c><00:12:20.740><c> too</c><00:12:21.040><c> many</c><00:12:21.340><c> times</c>

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
650 so don't take them too many times
 

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.390 align:start position:0%
650 so don't take them too many times
but<00:12:22.960><c> as</c><00:12:23.050><c> I</c><00:12:23.080><c> said</c><00:12:23.410><c> like</c><00:12:23.680><c> because</c><00:12:24.040><c> you're</c><00:12:24.220><c> taking</c>

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
but as I said like because you're taking
 

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.070 align:start position:0%
but as I said like because you're taking
them<00:12:24.820><c> at</c><00:12:25.060><c> home</c><00:12:25.390><c> you're</c><00:12:25.720><c> not</c><00:12:25.840><c> really</c>

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
them at home you're not really
 

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.710 align:start position:0%
them at home you're not really
concentrated<00:12:26.860><c> so</c><00:12:27.340><c> I</c><00:12:27.670><c> scored</c><00:12:28.210><c> I</c><00:12:28.450><c> actually</c>

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
concentrated so I scored I actually
 

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
concentrated so I scored I actually
scored<00:12:29.020><c> more</c><00:12:29.380><c> than</c><00:12:29.860><c> I</c><00:12:30.250><c> scored</c><00:12:30.700><c> on</c><00:12:30.820><c> my</c><00:12:30.940><c> practice</c>

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:31.390 align:start position:0%
scored more than I scored on my practice
 

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.170 align:start position:0%
scored more than I scored on my practice
tests<00:12:31.780><c> so</c><00:12:32.680><c> the</c><00:12:32.830><c> average</c><00:12:33.010><c> that</c><00:12:33.670><c> I</c><00:12:33.730><c> scored</c><00:12:34.060><c> on</c>

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:34.180 align:start position:0%
tests so the average that I scored on
 

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.330 align:start position:0%
tests so the average that I scored on
the<00:12:34.240><c> practice</c><00:12:34.600><c> test</c><00:12:34.810><c> would</c><00:12:35.050><c> be</c><00:12:35.170><c> like</c><00:12:35.350><c> 680</c><00:12:36.040><c> but</c>

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:36.340 align:start position:0%
the practice test would be like 680 but
 

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
the practice test would be like 680 but
I<00:12:36.370><c> ended</c><00:12:36.670><c> up</c><00:12:36.790><c> scoring</c><00:12:37.000><c> 700</c><00:12:37.720><c> so</c><00:12:38.230><c> just</c><00:12:39.070><c> make</c><00:12:39.220><c> sure</c>

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.250 align:start position:0%
I ended up scoring 700 so just make sure
 

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.520 align:start position:0%

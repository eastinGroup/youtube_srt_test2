00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.860 align:start position:0%

because<00:06:42.710><c> we</c><00:06:42.740><c> were</c><00:06:43.100><c> profitable</c><00:06:43.670><c> but</c><00:06:44.180><c> not</c><00:06:44.480><c> that</c>

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 align:start position:0%
because we were profitable but not that
 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.750 align:start position:0%
because we were profitable but not that

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 align:start position:0%

the developer costs he costs a lot of

then<00:06:56.060><c> we</c><00:06:56.240><c> realized</c><00:06:56.600><c> it</c><00:06:56.750><c> doesn't</c><00:06:56.870><c> work</c><00:06:57.290><c> so</c><00:06:57.590><c> we</c>

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 align:start position:0%
then we realized it doesn't work so we
 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
then we realized it doesn't work so we

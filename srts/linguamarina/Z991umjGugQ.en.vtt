00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.110 align:start position:0%
actual test and it's really good if

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
have the real test and you would have
 

00:09:48.319 --> 00:09:50.230 align:start position:0%
have the real test and you would have
some<00:09:48.709><c> time</c><00:09:48.980><c> to</c><00:09:49.220><c> sit</c><00:09:49.399><c> down</c><00:09:49.579><c> before</c><00:09:49.790><c> your</c><00:09:50.060><c> test</c>

the you know the ui/ux everything would

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:58.190 align:start position:0%
be the same as in real time so I really
 

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.620 align:start position:0%
be the same as in real time so I really
advise<00:09:58.399><c> it</c><00:09:58.550><c> to</c><00:09:58.579><c> download</c><00:09:58.940><c> it</c>

00:09:59.620 --> 00:09:59.630 align:start position:0%

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.090 align:start position:0%
advise it to download it
I'll<00:10:00.470><c> try</c><00:10:00.800><c> to</c><00:10:00.829><c> find</c><00:10:01.069><c> the</c><00:10:01.250><c> link</c><00:10:01.459><c> but</c><00:10:01.790><c> I</c><00:10:02.060><c> think</c><00:10:02.600><c> I</c>

have this boot correcting the TOI full
now<00:10:20.959><c> it's</c><00:10:21.110><c> the</c><00:10:21.230><c> time</c><00:10:21.410><c> to</c><00:10:21.470><c> actually</c><00:10:22.250><c> sit</c><00:10:22.760><c> down</c>

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:22.790 align:start position:0%
now it's the time to actually sit down
 

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.939 align:start position:0%
now it's the time to actually sit down
and<00:10:22.940><c> take</c><00:10:23.300><c> the</c><00:10:23.420><c> practice</c><00:10:23.630><c> test</c><00:10:23.870><c> and</c><00:10:24.230><c> see</c><00:10:24.529><c> what</c>

00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:24.949 align:start position:0%
and take the practice test and see what
 

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:27.970 align:start position:0%
and take the practice test and see what

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:27.980 align:start position:0%
which parts out the hardest for you so I
 

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.100 align:start position:0%
which parts out the hardest for you so I

at all it was really average and my

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.050 align:start position:0%
speaking part was like the worst because
 

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.840 align:start position:0%

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:40.850 align:start position:0%
when I first circuit I thought while I
 

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
when I first circuit I thought while I
would<00:10:41.060><c> never</c><00:10:41.240><c> ever</c>

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:41.730 align:start position:0%
would never ever
 

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
would never ever
able<00:10:42.000><c> to</c><00:10:42.149><c> do</c><00:10:42.300><c> that</c><00:10:42.449><c> so</c><00:10:43.170><c> I</c><00:10:43.199><c> decided</c><00:10:43.709><c> to</c><00:10:43.860><c> start</c>

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.370 align:start position:0%
able to do that so I decided to start
 

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.069 align:start position:0%
able to do that so I decided to start
with<00:10:44.670><c> the</c><00:10:44.790><c> most</c><00:10:44.940><c> difficult</c><00:10:45.420><c> part</c><00:10:45.630><c> for</c><00:10:45.690><c> me</c><00:10:45.899><c> and</c>

00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
with the most difficult part for me and
 

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:48.110 align:start position:0%
with the most difficult part for me and
this<00:10:46.230><c> is</c><00:10:46.410><c> actually</c><00:10:46.769><c> the</c><00:10:46.860><c> best</c><00:10:47.010><c> strategy</c><00:10:47.610><c> so</c>

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
this is actually the best strategy so
 

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.910 align:start position:0%
this is actually the best strategy so
once<00:10:48.300><c> you</c><00:10:48.420><c> do</c><00:10:48.540><c> the</c><00:10:48.660><c> practice</c><00:10:49.110><c> test</c><00:10:49.350><c> you</c><00:10:49.740><c> will</c>

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
once you do the practice test you will
 

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
once you do the practice test you will
have<00:10:50.130><c> the</c><00:10:50.339><c> answers</c><00:10:50.760><c> you</c><00:10:51.360><c> will</c><00:10:51.540><c> have</c>

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:52.370 align:start position:0%
have the answers you will have
 

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.650 align:start position:0%
have the answers you will have

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:34.350 align:start position:0%
have reading part listening part and
 

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.050 align:start position:0%
have reading part listening part and
then<00:12:34.440><c> you</c><00:12:34.470><c> would</c><00:12:34.680><c> have</c><00:12:34.769><c> a</c><00:12:34.829><c> break</c><00:12:35.069><c> so</c><00:12:35.850><c> make</c><00:12:36.029><c> sure</c>

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
then you would have a break so make sure
 

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.540 align:start position:0%
then you would have a break so make sure
you<00:12:36.510><c> don't</c><00:12:36.660><c> come</c><00:12:37.079><c> back</c><00:12:37.319><c> first</c><00:12:38.040><c> from</c><00:12:38.250><c> the</c><00:12:38.370><c> break</c>

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:38.550 align:start position:0%
you don't come back first from the break
 

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
you don't come back first from the break

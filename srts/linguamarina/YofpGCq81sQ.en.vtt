00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.210 align:start position:0%
talking to the residents manager is the
 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.110 align:start position:0%
talking to the residents manager is the

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
best because first he wouldn't have to
 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.750 align:start position:0%

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:50.980 align:start position:0%
residents manager always comes up with

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
problem and he has to be aware of what's
 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.670 align:start position:0%
problem and he has to be aware of what's

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
happening in the residence this is why I
 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
happening in the residence this is why I

00:07:59.520 --> 00:07:59.530 align:start position:0%
think the second solution is the best so
 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
think the second solution is the best so
by<00:07:59.920><c> using</c><00:08:00.070><c> this</c><00:08:00.400><c> simple</c><00:08:01.030><c> template</c><00:08:01.660><c> you</c><00:08:01.930><c> will</c>

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.170 align:start position:0%
by using this simple template you will
 

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
by using this simple template you will

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:05.770 align:start position:0%
reduce a lot of thinking time and you
 

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
reduce a lot of thinking time and you
would<00:08:05.920><c> have</c><00:08:06.130><c> more</c><00:08:06.490><c> time</c><00:08:06.700><c> to</c><00:08:06.880><c> concentrate</c><00:08:07.450><c> on</c>

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:07.810 align:start position:0%
would have more time to concentrate on
 

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
would have more time to concentrate on

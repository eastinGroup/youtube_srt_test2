it looks in there
 

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:21.850 align:start position:0%
do something that was like super 3d but
 

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
do something that was like super 3d but

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:23.230 align:start position:0%
it end up coming at like twelve thousand
 

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
it end up coming at like twelve thousand

00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:31.449 align:start position:0%
on that was broken so I'm going over
 

00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:33.569 align:start position:0%
on that was broken so I'm going over

00:11:33.569 --> 00:11:33.579 align:start position:0%
with the black block out paint and then
 

00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:35.429 align:start position:0%
with the black block out paint and then
they<00:11:34.149><c> want</c><00:11:34.360><c> it</c><00:11:34.480><c> white</c><00:11:34.689><c> to</c><00:11:34.720><c> match</c><00:11:35.050><c> the</c><00:11:35.290><c> white</c>

00:11:35.439 --> 00:11:36.809 align:start position:0%
they want it white to match the white

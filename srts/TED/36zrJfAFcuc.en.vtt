[Applause]

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:27.010
 in the evening or good morning I do not know what time it is there at any time I am though

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.200
 happy to attend your meeting I really liked the title

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:45.489
 the feature because while looking to the future in a comfortable life today to dialogue

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:53.800
 looking to the future invites you to contact a trustee

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:02.860
 the future is made of you, that is, it is made up of encounters because life flows

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.479
 through relationships several years of life have made me mature more and more

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.680
 the conviction that the existence of each of us is linked to that of

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.470
 others life is not a passing time

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 but time to meet

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.880
 meeting by listening to sick suffering migrants they face

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.050
 tremendous difficulties in search of a better future leading prisoners

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.270
 hell in their hearts especially young people who don't have

00:01:49.270 --> 00:02:00.360
 work often accompanies me a question why them that not me

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.780
 I too was born into a migrant family my dad

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.459
 my grandparents like many other italians left for argentina and have

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.230
 known the fate of those who are left with nothing

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.250
 I too could have been among the discarded of today therefore in my heart

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.950
 it always remains the same because I would like them and not me

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.930
 first of all that this meeting helps us to remember that we all have

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.720
 each other's need that none of us are an island an autonomous self and

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.910
 independent from others that we can build the future only together without

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:06.130
 exclude anyone we often do not think about it but in reality

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:14.150
 everything is connected and we need to heal our connections too

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.120
 that harsh judgment that I carry in my heart against my brother and that sister

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.060
 untreated wound that evil not forgiven that rancor that will only make me

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.120
 evil and a bit of war that I carry inside and an outbreak in the heart from

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.920
 extinguish lest it ignite in a fire that does not leave many genus today

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.019
 for various reasons they seem not to believe that a happy future is possible

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:56.500
 these fears must be taken seriously but they are not invincible and can be overcome

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.680
 if not what we also close in on ourselves because happiness is experienced

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:12.109
 only as a gift of harmony of every detail with everything, even the sciences

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:20.090
 you know it better than I show us today an understanding of reality where every

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.600
 what exists in connection in continuous interaction with the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:38.300
 others and here I come to my second message how nice it would be if the

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:46.010
 growth of scientific and technological innovations also matched one

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:53.090
 more and more equity and social inclusion how nice it would be if while

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.990
 we discover new distant planets we rediscover the needs of our brother e

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.880
 of the sister who orbit around me how nice that fraternity would be

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.090
 this word so beautiful sometimes scoma would not reduce us alone

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.080
 social assistance but became a basic attitude in the choices a

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.950
 political economic scientific level in the relations between people among peoples

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:38.200
 and countries only education in fraternity in concrete solidarity

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:49.550
 it can overcome the throwaway culture that is not just about food and goods but

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:57.200
 first of all people who are marginalized by techno and economic systems

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:06.500
 where at the center, without realizing it, there is often no longer the man but the products

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.190
 of man

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:17.590
 solidarity is a word that many want to remove from the dictionary

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.900
 solidarity however is not an automatic mechanism it cannot be programmed either

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.039
 commander and a free response that comes from

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:35.210
 heart of each yes a free answer if 1 understands

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:41.030
 that his life even in the midst of so many contradictions and a gift that love is

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:47.719
 the source and meaning of life as it will draw hold back desire

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:54.259
 doing good to others to be active in good requires memory

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:59.979
 it takes courage and also creativity

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:09.189
 they told me that you sort out a lot of very creative people

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:20.719
 yes love and asking for an ingenious concrete creative answer are not enough

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:28.270
 the good intentions and the ritual formulas that he breaks that often only serve a

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:36.229
 calm conscience together let us help remember that others do not

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:42.589
 they are statistics or numbers the other has a face

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:51.339
 the tool is always a concrete face, a brother to take care of

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:59.389
 there is a story that jesus told to make people understand the difference between

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:06.969
 who does not bother and who takes care of the other

00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:14.419
 you have probably heard of it is the parable of the good Samaritan when

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:22.389
 they asked jesus who my neighbor is, that is, who should i take care of

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:27.979
 Jesus told this story the story of a man the thieves had

00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:34.710
 assaulted by stolen abandoned path along the road two people

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:41.310
 very respectable of the time a priest a Levite saw him but

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:49.020
 they passed by without stopping then came a Samaritan who belonged to

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:56.070
 a despised ethnic group and this Samaritan at the sight of that man

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.740
 wounded on the ground did not pass over like the others as if

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:09.240
 nothing had happened but he had compassion for it he was moved and

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:17.430
 this compassion leads him to make very concrete gestures towards oil

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:25.020
 and wine on that man's wounds brought him a tree and paid out of his own pocket for

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.350
 his assistance the story of the good Samaritan and the history of humanity of

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:38.550
 today on the path of peoples there are wounds caused by the fact that at the center

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:44.940
 there is money there is things not people

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:52.110
 and there is often the habit of those who believe themselves to be good not to care about

00:09:52.110 --> 00:10:02.460
 others leaving so many human beings whole peoples back to earth for the

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.090
 Street

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.190
 however, there are also those who give life to a new world

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:18.540
 taking care of others even at their own expense, in fact, mother said

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:26.390
 Teresa of Calcutta cannot be loved except at one's own expense

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.270
 we have a lot to do and we must do it together

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.880
 but how to deal with the evil we breathe

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:44.990
 thank god no system can undo the opening to the good

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:51.740
 compassion and the ability to react to evil that arise from the heart of man

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.500
 now you will tell me they are beautiful words but I am not even a Samaritan

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:06.670
 mother teresa of calcutta instead each of us is precious each of us and

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:13.970
 irreplaceable in the eyes of God in the night of the conflicts that we are

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:19.040
 crossing each of us can be a candle

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:27.700
 lit that reminds that light prevails over darkness not the other way around

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:38.270
 for us Christians the future has a name that this name hope has hope

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:47.930
 it does not mean being naive optimists who ignore the drama of evil and

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:55.820
 of humanity the hope and virtue of a heart that does not close in the dark does not

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:04.610
 he stops at the past he does not vivacchia in the present but he knows how to see tomorrow there

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:11.330
 hope and the open door on coming hope is a seed of humble life

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:19.360
 hidden which, however, over time turns into a large tree and like a yeast

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:27.230
 invisible that makes all the pasta grow that gives flavor to all life e

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:36.580
 it can do so much because a single small light is enough to feed on hope

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:45.830
 and the darkness will no longer be complete, only one man is enough for there to be

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:58.390
 hope and that man can be you then there is another tool is another tool e

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:06.910
 then we become us and when there is us, hope begins, not that

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:17.890
 started with you when there is a revolution in us begins the third e

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:23.709
 The last message I would like to share today is about the revolution there

00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:31.180
 revolution of tenderness what is tenderness and love that comes close

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:38.410
 and concrete is a movement that starts from the heart reaches the eyes to the ears

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.670
 to the hands tenderness and use the eyes to

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:48.790
 see the other use the ears to hear the other to hear the cry

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:55.360
 of the little ones of the poor of those who fear the future also listen to the cry

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:02.860
 silent of our common home of the contaminated earth is sick there

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:11.410
 tenderness means using your hands and heart to caress each other for

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:18.430
 tenderness is the language of most people to take care of him

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:28.060
 little ones of those who need the other a child becomes fond of and knows the father and

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:36.570
 the mother for the caresses for the look for the voice for the tenderness

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:44.490
 I like to hear when dad or mom talk to their little baby

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:52.769
 when they too become children by speaking as the child speaks

00:14:52.769 --> 00:15:00.170
 this is the tender age to lower oneself to the level of the other too

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:06.820
 god lowered himself in jesus to rise to our level

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.240
 this is the road traveled by the good Samaritan

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:18.290
 this is the road traveled by jesus who is based who went through the whole

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:26.660
 life of man with a concrete language of love yes tenderness and

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:35.240
 the path that the bravest and strongest men and women have traveled is not

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:42.290
 weakness the tenderness and strength and the road of solidarity the road

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:50.990
 of humility let me make it clear how much more powerful how much

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:57.649
 the more your actions impact people the more you are called to be

00:15:57.649 --> 00:16:08.950
 humble because otherwise power will ruin you and you will ruin others

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:18.850
 in Argentina it was said that power is like the gene taken on an empty stomach

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:27.560
 who makes you dizzy makes you drunk makes you lose your balance and leads you to

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:35.540
 hurt yourself and others if you don't combine it with humility e

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:47.329
 to tenderness with humility and concrete love instead the highest power is the

00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:56.959
 the stronger it becomes service and spreads the good, the future of humanity is not alone

00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:03.079
 in the hands of the politicians of the great leaders of large companies

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:10.179
 yes their huge responsibility but the future is above all in the hands

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:17.199
 of people who recognize each other as a tool and themselves as part of

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:24.420
 a we need from each other and therefore please

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:30.190
 remember me also with tenderness so that the task that was me may arise

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:39.630
 entrusted for the sake of others of all of you of all of us

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:52.470
 thank you [Applause]

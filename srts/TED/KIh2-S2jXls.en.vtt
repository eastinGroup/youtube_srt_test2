00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.430 align:start position:0%
and and so we're starting to see a spike
 

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.730 align:start position:0%

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:21.740 align:start position:0%
before this week the highest infection
 

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.160 align:start position:0%

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:26.300 align:start position:0%
two months of this was was ten
 

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.380 align:start position:0%
two months of this was was ten
infections<00:22:26.780><c> and</c><00:22:26.990><c> one</c><00:22:27.380><c> day</c><00:22:27.610><c> now</c><00:22:28.610><c> the</c><00:22:28.670><c> highest</c>

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:29.390 align:start position:0%

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.790 align:start position:0%
infections and one day now the highest
that<00:22:29.510><c> we've</c><00:22:29.630><c> seen</c><00:22:29.810><c> in</c><00:22:29.930><c> the</c><00:22:29.990><c> last</c><00:22:30.020><c> week</c><00:22:30.320><c> was</c><00:22:30.410><c> 48</c>

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in the last week was 48
 

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in the last week was 48
so<00:22:31.250><c> this</c><00:22:31.640><c> is</c><00:22:31.820><c> really</c><00:22:32.270><c> the</c><00:22:32.390><c> first</c><00:22:32.660><c> spike</c><00:22:33.080><c> that</c>

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:33.290 align:start position:0%
so this is really the first spike that
 

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.900 align:start position:0%
so this is really the first spike that
we're<00:22:33.410><c> seeing</c><00:22:33.620><c> and</c><00:22:33.830><c> so</c><00:22:34.010><c> Hong</c><00:22:34.220><c> Kong</c><00:22:34.430><c> is</c>

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:34.910 align:start position:0%
we're seeing and so Hong Kong is
 

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.090 align:start position:0%
we're seeing and so Hong Kong is

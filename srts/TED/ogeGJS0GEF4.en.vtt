and<00:08:52.870><c> so</c><00:08:53.200><c> because</c><00:08:53.470><c> this</c><00:08:53.590><c> is</c><00:08:53.650><c> TEDx</c><00:08:54.190><c> Exeter</c><00:08:54.820><c> I</c>

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
and so because this is TEDx Exeter I
 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
and so because this is TEDx Exeter I
thought<00:08:55.330><c> we</c><00:08:55.510><c> would</c><00:08:55.660><c> have</c><00:08:55.780><c> a</c><00:08:55.810><c> quick</c><00:08:56.110><c> look</c><00:08:56.260><c> at</c>

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.410 align:start position:0%
thought we would have a quick look at
 

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
thought we would have a quick look at

the quiz for the first few questions of

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:00.820 align:start position:0%
Exeter and so the first question is for
 

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.090 align:start position:0%
Exeter and so the first question is for

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:06.670 align:start position:0%
16 now I don't know Exeter very well at
 

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.490 align:start position:0%
16 now I don't know Exeter very well at

there'll be more puddles around so

there will be more malaria or there

could be more malaria but it also could

could be more malaria but it also could

00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:46.019 align:start position:0%
mean that there'd be more flooding and
 

00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
mean that there'd be more flooding and

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:47.610 align:start position:0%
if there's more flooding then that would
 

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.850 align:start position:0%
if there's more flooding then that would

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
wash more mosquito eggs away and so
 

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.070 align:start position:0%
wash more mosquito eggs away and so
you'd<00:18:49.980><c> have</c><00:18:50.009><c> less</c><00:18:50.549><c> mosquitoes</c><00:18:51.090><c> and</c><00:18:51.299><c> so</c><00:18:51.929><c> then</c>

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
you'd have less mosquitoes and so then
 

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
you'd have less mosquitoes and so then
you<00:18:52.200><c> might</c><00:18:52.350><c> have</c><00:18:52.529><c> less</c><00:18:52.769><c> malaria</c><00:18:53.250><c> around</c><00:18:53.549><c> so</c>

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:53.970 align:start position:0%
you might have less malaria around so
 

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.690 align:start position:0%
you might have less malaria around so

the the impact is going to vary but I

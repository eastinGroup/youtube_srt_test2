we<00:06:02.430><c> did</c><00:06:02.610><c> it</c><00:06:02.639><c> was</c><00:06:02.789><c> by</c><00:06:03.120><c> coming</c><00:06:03.719><c> back</c><00:06:03.870><c> to</c><00:06:04.110><c> this</c>

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 align:start position:0%
we did it was by coming back to this
 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
we did it was by coming back to this
typical<00:06:04.710><c> tissue</c><00:06:05.009><c> engineering</c><00:06:05.490><c> approach</c><00:06:05.849><c> but</c>

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 align:start position:0%
typical tissue engineering approach but
 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:07.399 align:start position:0%
typical tissue engineering approach but
actually<00:06:06.389><c> thinking</c><00:06:06.779><c> about</c><00:06:06.899><c> it</c><00:06:07.229><c> rather</c>

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 align:start position:0%
actually thinking about it rather
 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.950 align:start position:0%
actually thinking about it rather
differently<00:06:07.949><c> and</c><00:06:08.129><c> we</c><00:06:08.939><c> simplified</c><00:06:09.539><c> it</c><00:06:09.569><c> a</c><00:06:09.810><c> lot</c>

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
differently and we simplified it a lot
 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
differently and we simplified it a lot
so<00:06:10.409><c> we</c><00:06:10.589><c> got</c><00:06:10.770><c> rid</c><00:06:11.009><c> of</c><00:06:11.039><c> a</c><00:06:11.250><c> lot</c><00:06:11.399><c> of</c><00:06:11.430><c> these</c><00:06:11.639><c> steps</c><00:06:12.000><c> we</c>

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 align:start position:0%
so we got rid of a lot of these steps we
 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.909 align:start position:0%
so we got rid of a lot of these steps we
got<00:06:12.539><c> rid</c><00:06:12.689><c> of</c><00:06:12.750><c> the</c><00:06:12.899><c> need</c><00:06:13.080><c> to</c><00:06:13.289><c> harvest</c><00:06:13.529><c> cells</c>

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
got rid of the need to harvest cells
 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.709 align:start position:0%

to put in really fancy chemistries and
 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.850 align:start position:0%

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
we got rid of a need to culture these
 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.269 align:start position:0%
we got rid of a need to culture these

making it quite simple but because we

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 align:start position:0%
used it in a really clever way we were
 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
used it in a really clever way we were

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 align:start position:0%
bone using this approach so we were
 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.999 align:start position:0%
bone using this approach so we were
using<00:06:35.610><c> the</c><00:06:35.729><c> body</c><00:06:35.940><c> as</c><00:06:36.209><c> really</c><00:06:37.169><c> the</c><00:06:37.289><c> catalyst</c><00:06:37.860><c> to</c>

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 align:start position:0%
using the body as really the catalyst to
 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.650 align:start position:0%
using the body as really the catalyst to

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
help us to make lots of new
 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.650 align:start position:0%
help us to make lots of new
boon<00:06:39.840><c> and</c><00:06:40.520><c> it's</c><00:06:41.520><c> an</c><00:06:41.670><c> approach</c><00:06:42.000><c> that</c><00:06:42.030><c> we</c><00:06:42.390><c> called</c>

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
boon and it's an approach that we called
 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.900 align:start position:0%
boon and it's an approach that we called
the<00:06:42.900><c> invivo</c><00:06:43.170><c> by</c><00:06:43.680><c> reactor</c><00:06:44.190><c> and</c><00:06:44.400><c> we</c><00:06:44.520><c> were</c><00:06:44.640><c> able</c>

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 align:start position:0%
the invivo by reactor and we were able
 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
the invivo by reactor and we were able
to<00:06:44.940><c> make</c><00:06:45.210><c> enormous</c><00:06:45.780><c> amounts</c><00:06:46.200><c> of</c><00:06:46.320><c> bone</c><00:06:46.560><c> using</c>

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 align:start position:0%
to make enormous amounts of bone using
 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.740 align:start position:0%
to make enormous amounts of bone using
this<00:06:47.130><c> approach</c><00:06:47.520><c> and</c><00:06:47.790><c> I'll</c><00:06:48.270><c> talk</c><00:06:48.510><c> you</c><00:06:48.540><c> through</c>

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 align:start position:0%
this approach and I'll talk you through
 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.730 align:start position:0%
this approach and I'll talk you through
this<00:06:49.080><c> so</c><00:06:49.350><c> what</c><00:06:49.560><c> we</c><00:06:49.710><c> do</c><00:06:49.920><c> is</c><00:06:50.840><c> in</c><00:06:51.840><c> humans</c><00:06:52.410><c> we</c><00:06:52.650><c> all</c>

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
this so what we do is in humans we all
 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.290 align:start position:0%
this so what we do is in humans we all
have<00:06:52.950><c> a</c><00:06:52.980><c> layer</c><00:06:53.190><c> of</c><00:06:53.310><c> stem</c><00:06:53.580><c> cells</c><00:06:53.880><c> on</c><00:06:54.180><c> the</c>

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
have a layer of stem cells on the
 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.210 align:start position:0%
have a layer of stem cells on the

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
outside of our long bones that layer is
 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.460 align:start position:0%
outside of our long bones that layer is

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 align:start position:0%
called the periosteum and that layer is
 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.650 align:start position:0%

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 align:start position:0%
with repairing the bone so we take that
 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.260 align:start position:0%
with repairing the bone so we take that
periosteum<00:07:13.680><c> layer</c><00:07:14.100><c> and</c><00:07:14.370><c> we</c><00:07:14.460><c> developed</c><00:07:14.970><c> a</c><00:07:15.120><c> way</c>

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 align:start position:0%
periosteum layer and we developed a way
 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.170 align:start position:0%

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
to inject underneath it a liquid that

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
then within 30 seconds would turn into
 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.030 align:start position:0%

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:21.390 align:start position:0%
make it even larger and that demarcation
 

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.940 align:start position:0%
make it even larger and that demarcation
that<00:08:21.810><c> you</c><00:08:21.900><c> can</c><00:08:22.080><c> see</c><00:08:22.260><c> between</c><00:08:22.470><c> the</c><00:08:22.800><c> original</c>

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300 align:start position:0%

put<00:10:08.610><c> it</c><00:10:08.730><c> in</c><00:10:08.880><c> there</c><00:10:09.060><c> and</c><00:10:09.210><c> we</c><00:10:09.600><c> were</c><00:10:09.750><c> able</c><00:10:09.870><c> to</c><00:10:10.020><c> get</c>

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
put it in there and we were able to get
 

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
put it in there and we were able to get
hundred-percent<00:10:10.920><c> cartilage</c><00:10:11.460><c> instead</c><00:10:11.940><c> and</c>

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:12.810 align:start position:0%
hundred-percent cartilage instead and
 

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.329 align:start position:0%

want to make them have enough

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:48.990 align:start position:0%
do what we want but not be so complex as
 

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.770 align:start position:0%
do what we want but not be so complex as

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:50.780 align:start position:0%
to make it difficult to get to clinic
 

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
to make it difficult to get to clinic
and<00:10:51.780><c> so</c><00:10:52.080><c> one</c><00:10:52.620><c> of</c><00:10:52.650><c> the</c><00:10:52.830><c> things</c><00:10:53.040><c> we</c><00:10:53.190><c> think</c><00:10:53.430><c> about</c>

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:53.610 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things we think about
 

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.730 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things we think about
a<00:10:53.790><c> lot</c><00:10:54.060><c> is</c><00:10:54.300><c> is</c><00:10:54.510><c> really</c><00:10:54.810><c> trying</c><00:10:55.050><c> to</c><00:10:55.110><c> understand</c>

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
a lot is is really trying to understand
 

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.100 align:start position:0%
a lot is is really trying to understand

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.110 align:start position:0%
the structure of the tissues in the body
 

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.460 align:start position:0%
the structure of the tissues in the body
and<00:10:58.350><c> so</c><00:10:58.860><c> if</c><00:10:58.920><c> we</c><00:10:59.040><c> think</c><00:10:59.250><c> of</c><00:10:59.460><c> bone</c><00:10:59.730><c> obviously</c><00:11:00.600><c> my</c>

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:01.470 align:start position:0%
and so if we think of bone obviously my
 

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
and so if we think of bone obviously my

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes much bigger than the cells

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
and so even though it's 3d the cell
might<00:12:14.960><c> see</c><00:12:15.230><c> it</c><00:12:15.290><c> more</c><00:12:15.650><c> as</c><00:12:15.800><c> a</c><00:12:15.830><c> slightly</c><00:12:16.280><c> curved</c>

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:16.610 align:start position:0%

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:18.470 align:start position:0%

know is that unfortunately if you have a

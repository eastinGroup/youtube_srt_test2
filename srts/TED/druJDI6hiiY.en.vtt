00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909 align:start position:0%
by Chase sorry three times is probably
 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
by Chase sorry three times is probably
but<00:06:50.909><c> you</c><00:06:50.939><c> get</c><00:06:51.120><c> the</c><00:06:51.240><c> idea</c><00:06:51.509><c> so</c><00:06:51.780><c> when</c><00:06:52.650><c> you</c><00:06:52.740><c> look</c><00:06:52.979><c> at</c>

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 align:start position:0%
but you get the idea so when you look at
 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.089 align:start position:0%
but you get the idea so when you look at
just<00:06:54.240><c> the</c><00:06:54.479><c> film</c><00:06:54.960><c> here</c><00:06:55.229><c> pretty</c><00:06:55.590><c> much</c><00:06:55.710><c> the</c><00:06:55.860><c> only</c>

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
just the film here pretty much the only
 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:57.409 align:start position:0%
just the film here pretty much the only
thing<00:06:56.280><c> you</c><00:06:56.400><c> can</c><00:06:56.520><c> see</c><00:06:56.699><c> is</c><00:06:56.819><c> he</c><00:06:56.939><c> got</c><00:06:57.090><c> hit</c><00:06:57.240><c> really</c>

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
thing you can see is he got hit really
 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.379 align:start position:0%
thing you can see is he got hit really
hard<00:06:57.689><c> and</c><00:06:57.840><c> he</c><00:06:57.930><c> was</c><00:06:58.050><c> hurt</c><00:06:58.229><c> but</c><00:06:59.069><c> when</c><00:06:59.490><c> we</c><00:06:59.699><c> extract</c>

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389 align:start position:0%
hard and he was hurt but when we extract
 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:01.850 align:start position:0%
hard and he was hurt but when we extract
the<00:07:00.599><c> data</c><00:07:00.780><c> out</c><00:07:00.990><c> of</c><00:07:01.050><c> the</c><00:07:01.169><c> mouth</c><00:07:01.349><c> guard</c><00:07:01.620><c> that</c><00:07:01.770><c> he</c>

the data out of the mouth guard that he
 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
the data out of the mouth guard that he
was<00:07:01.979><c> wearing</c><00:07:02.159><c> we</c><00:07:02.400><c> can</c><00:07:02.550><c> see</c><00:07:02.789><c> much</c><00:07:03.120><c> more</c><00:07:03.360><c> detail</c>

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 align:start position:0%
was wearing we can see much more detail
 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.110 align:start position:0%
was wearing we can see much more detail
much<00:07:04.229><c> richer</c><00:07:04.560><c> information</c><00:07:04.710><c> and</c><00:07:05.340><c> one</c><00:07:05.969><c> of</c><00:07:06.060><c> the</c>

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
much richer information and one of the
 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
much richer information and one of the
things<00:07:06.360><c> that</c><00:07:06.810><c> we</c><00:07:06.930><c> noticed</c><00:07:07.289><c> here</c><00:07:07.680><c> is</c><00:07:07.770><c> that</c><00:07:08.490><c> he</c>

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 align:start position:0%
things that we noticed here is that he
 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.179 align:start position:0%
things that we noticed here is that he
was<00:07:09.240><c> struck</c><00:07:09.599><c> in</c><00:07:09.629><c> the</c><00:07:09.870><c> lower</c><00:07:10.110><c> left</c><00:07:10.590><c> side</c><00:07:10.830><c> of</c><00:07:11.129><c> his</c>

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:11.189 align:start position:0%
was struck in the lower left side of his

was struck in the lower left side of his
face<00:07:11.250><c> mask</c><00:07:11.669><c> and</c><00:07:12.090><c> so</c><00:07:12.419><c> that</c><00:07:12.569><c> did</c><00:07:12.719><c> something</c>

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 align:start position:0%
face mask and so that did something
 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.939 align:start position:0%
face mask and so that did something
first<00:07:13.259><c> it</c><00:07:13.379><c> was</c><00:07:13.469><c> a</c><00:07:13.500><c> little</c><00:07:13.530><c> counterintuitive</c>

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:13.949 align:start position:0%
first it was a little counterintuitive
 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:15.980 align:start position:0%
first it was a little counterintuitive
his<00:07:14.520><c> left</c><00:07:14.729><c> his</c><00:07:14.969><c> head</c><00:07:15.210><c> did</c><00:07:15.389><c> not</c><00:07:15.419><c> move</c><00:07:15.750><c> to</c><00:07:15.900><c> the</c>

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 align:start position:0%
his left his head did not move to the
 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.110 align:start position:0%
his left his head did not move to the

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
right in fact it rotated first to the
 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
right in fact it rotated first to the

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 align:start position:0%
left then as the neck began to compress
 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.719 align:start position:0%
left then as the neck began to compress
the<00:07:22.080><c> force</c><00:07:22.409><c> of</c><00:07:22.590><c> the</c><00:07:22.680><c> blow</c><00:07:22.889><c> cause</c><00:07:23.219><c> it</c><00:07:23.490><c> to</c><00:07:23.580><c> whip</c>

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:23.729 align:start position:0%
the force of the blow cause it to whip
 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:26.779 align:start position:0%
the force of the blow cause it to whip
back<00:07:23.909><c> to</c><00:07:23.969><c> the</c><00:07:24.240><c> right</c><00:07:24.419><c> so</c><00:07:25.259><c> this</c><00:07:26.129><c> left</c><00:07:26.580><c> right</c>

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:26.789 align:start position:0%
back to the right so this left right
 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
back to the right so this left right
motion<00:07:27.060><c> was</c><00:07:27.659><c> sort</c><00:07:28.169><c> of</c><00:07:28.199><c> a</c><00:07:28.319><c> whiplash</c><00:07:28.669><c> type</c>

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.810 align:start position:0%
motion was sort of a whiplash type

motion was sort of a whiplash type
phenomenon<00:07:30.810><c> and</c><00:07:31.050><c> then</c><00:07:31.889><c> we</c><00:07:31.979><c> think</c><00:07:32.250><c> that</c><00:07:32.400><c> is</c>

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
phenomenon and then we think that is
 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.510 align:start position:0%
phenomenon and then we think that is
probably<00:07:32.849><c> what</c><00:07:33.509><c> led</c><00:07:33.539><c> to</c><00:07:33.780><c> the</c><00:07:34.080><c> brain</c><00:07:34.289><c> injury</c>

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
probably what led to the brain injury
 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.369 align:start position:0%
probably what led to the brain injury
now<00:07:35.520><c> this</c><00:07:35.699><c> device</c><00:07:35.849><c> is</c><00:07:36.210><c> only</c><00:07:36.419><c> limited</c><00:07:36.840><c> in</c><00:07:37.139><c> such</c>

00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:37.379 align:start position:0%
now this device is only limited in such
 

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:39.290 align:start position:0%
now this device is only limited in such
that<00:07:37.529><c> it</c><00:07:37.650><c> can</c><00:07:37.770><c> measure</c><00:07:38.009><c> the</c><00:07:38.400><c> skull</c><00:07:38.789><c> motion</c><00:07:39.180><c> but</c>

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
that it can measure the skull motion but
 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.490 align:start position:0%
that it can measure the skull motion but
what<00:07:39.449><c> we</c><00:07:39.569><c> really</c><00:07:39.840><c> want</c><00:07:39.870><c> to</c><00:07:40.080><c> know</c><00:07:40.199><c> is</c><00:07:40.319><c> what's</c>

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
what we really want to know is what's
 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.529 align:start position:0%
what we really want to know is what's
happening<00:07:40.800><c> inside</c><00:07:41.009><c> of</c><00:07:41.129><c> the</c><00:07:41.190><c> brain</c><00:07:41.419><c> so</c><00:07:42.419><c> we</c>

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
happening inside of the brain so we
 

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
happening inside of the brain so we

concussion is more likely when you're
 

00:08:45.209 --> 00:08:47.630 align:start position:0%

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
direction this is more common in sports
like<00:08:50.790><c> football</c><00:08:50.850><c> but</c><00:08:51.390><c> this</c><00:08:51.540><c> seems</c><00:08:51.779><c> to</c><00:08:51.930><c> be</c><00:08:51.959><c> more</c>

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.170 align:start position:0%

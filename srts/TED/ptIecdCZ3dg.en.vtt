00:15:49.569 --> 00:15:49.579 align:start position:0%
looking into the camera can increase
 

00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
looking into the camera can increase
those<00:15:49.930><c> neurotransmitters</c><00:15:50.930><c> or</c><00:15:51.079><c> maybe</c>

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:51.649 align:start position:0%
those neurotransmitters or maybe
 

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:53.980 align:start position:0%
those neurotransmitters or maybe
changing<00:15:52.490><c> the</c><00:15:52.579><c> position</c><00:15:52.970><c> of</c><00:15:53.059><c> the</c><00:15:53.180><c> camera</c><00:15:53.360><c> so</c>

changing the position of the camera so
 

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.689 align:start position:0%
changing the position of the camera so
it's<00:15:54.230><c> not</c><00:15:54.439><c> identical</c><00:15:54.649><c> but</c><00:15:55.189><c> I</c><00:15:55.220><c> think</c><00:15:55.459><c> we</c><00:15:55.579><c> are</c>

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:55.699 align:start position:0%
it's not identical but I think we are
 

00:15:55.699 --> 00:15:57.699 align:start position:0%
it's not identical but I think we are
getting<00:15:55.939><c> closer</c><00:15:56.389><c> with</c><00:15:56.720><c> the</c><00:15:56.990><c> technology</c><00:15:57.499><c> right</c>

00:15:57.699 --> 00:15:57.709 align:start position:0%
getting closer with the technology right
 

00:15:57.709 --> 00:16:00.999 align:start position:0%
getting closer with the technology right
thank<00:15:58.040><c> you</c><00:15:58.160><c> so</c><00:15:58.309><c> much</c><00:15:58.459><c> thank</c><00:15:58.879><c> you</c>

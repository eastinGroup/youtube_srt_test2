00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 align:start position:0%
core temperature would start to drop and
 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.429 align:start position:0%
core temperature would start to drop and
I<00:03:45.819><c> was</c><00:03:45.970><c> shivering</c><00:03:46.239><c> and</c><00:03:46.569><c> my</c><00:03:46.720><c> first</c><00:03:47.019><c> attempt</c><00:03:47.409><c> to</c>

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
I was shivering and my first attempt to

hold my breath for a really long time

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 align:start position:0%
how could it be done and he said David
 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.470 align:start position:0%
how could it be done and he said David
you're<00:04:08.079><c> a</c><00:04:08.109><c> magician</c><00:04:08.639><c> create</c><00:04:09.639><c> the</c><00:04:09.849><c> illusion</c><00:04:10.120><c> of</c>

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
you're a magician create the illusion of
 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.330 align:start position:0%
you're a magician create the illusion of
not<00:04:10.720><c> breathing</c><00:04:11.170><c> it'll</c><00:04:11.349><c> be</c><00:04:11.470><c> much</c><00:04:11.680><c> easier</c>

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.849 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:04:16.340><c> he</c><00:04:16.519><c> came</c><00:04:16.759><c> up</c><00:04:16.970><c> with</c><00:04:17.150><c> this</c><00:04:17.269><c> idea</c><00:04:17.479><c> of</c><00:04:18.079><c> creating</c>

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 align:start position:0%
so he came up with this idea of creating
 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.170 align:start position:0%
so he came up with this idea of creating
a<00:04:19.130><c> rebreather</c><00:04:19.870><c> with</c><00:04:20.870><c> a</c><00:04:20.900><c> co2</c><00:04:21.320><c> scrubber</c><00:04:22.250><c> which</c>

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 align:start position:0%
a rebreather with a co2 scrubber which
 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.950 align:start position:0%
a rebreather with a co2 scrubber which

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
was basically a a tube from Home Depot
 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.460 align:start position:0%

with the balloons duct-taped to it that
 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
with the balloons duct-taped to it that
he<00:04:30.770><c> thought</c><00:04:31.039><c> we</c><00:04:31.370><c> could</c><00:04:31.580><c> put</c><00:04:31.880><c> inside</c><00:04:32.870><c> of</c><00:04:33.169><c> me</c><00:04:33.380><c> and</c>

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 align:start position:0%
he thought we could put inside of me and
 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
he thought we could put inside of me and
somehow<00:04:34.280><c> be</c><00:04:34.669><c> able</c><00:04:34.850><c> to</c><00:04:35.350><c> circulate</c><00:04:36.350><c> the</c><00:04:36.380><c> air</c><00:04:36.560><c> and</c>

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 align:start position:0%
somehow be able to circulate the air and
 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.999 align:start position:0%
somehow be able to circulate the air and
rebreathe<00:04:37.460><c> with</c><00:04:38.030><c> this</c><00:04:38.240><c> thing</c><00:04:38.539><c> in</c><00:04:38.720><c> me</c><00:04:39.009><c> that</c>

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 align:start position:0%
rebreathe with this thing in me that
 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.540 align:start position:0%
rebreathe with this thing in me that

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 align:start position:0%
this is a little hard to watch but this
 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
this is a little hard to watch but this
is<00:04:43.729><c> that</c><00:04:44.479><c> attempt</c>

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.710 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:04:52.250><c> that</c><00:04:52.400><c> clearly</c><00:04:52.880><c> wasn't</c><00:04:53.120><c> gonna</c><00:04:53.360><c> work</c>

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.340 align:start position:0%
 
then<00:04:58.410><c> I</c><00:04:58.440><c> actually</c><00:04:58.800><c> started</c><00:04:59.130><c> thinking</c><00:05:00.030><c> about</c>

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 align:start position:0%
then I actually started thinking about
 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
then I actually started thinking about
liquid<00:05:01.350><c> breathing</c><00:05:01.980><c> there's</c><00:05:02.670><c> a</c><00:05:02.760><c> chemical</c>

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 align:start position:0%
liquid breathing there's a chemical
 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
liquid breathing there's a chemical

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 align:start position:0%
that's called per flu Bron and it's so
 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.450 align:start position:0%
that's called per flu Bron and it's so

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
high in oxygen levels that in theory you
 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.940 align:start position:0%
high in oxygen levels that in theory you
could<00:05:08.640><c> breathe</c><00:05:08.970><c> it</c><00:05:09.240><c> so</c><00:05:09.990><c> I</c><00:05:10.020><c> got</c><00:05:10.290><c> my</c><00:05:10.500><c> hands</c><00:05:10.890><c> on</c>

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 align:start position:0%
could breathe it so I got my hands on
 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.610 align:start position:0%
could breathe it so I got my hands on
that<00:05:11.160><c> chemical</c><00:05:11.730><c> filled</c><00:05:12.360><c> the</c><00:05:12.570><c> sink</c><00:05:12.900><c> up</c><00:05:13.140><c> with</c><00:05:13.170><c> it</c>

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
that chemical filled the sink up with it
 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.010 align:start position:0%
that chemical filled the sink up with it

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
and stuck my face in the sink and tried
 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.260 align:start position:0%
and stuck my face in the sink and tried

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
idea disappeared
 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.450 align:start position:0%
idea disappeared
then<00:05:27.030><c> I</c><00:05:27.060><c> started</c><00:05:27.630><c> thinking</c><00:05:28.220><c> would</c><00:05:29.220><c> it</c><00:05:29.250><c> be</c>

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
then I started thinking would it be
 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
then I started thinking would it be

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:17.190 align:start position:0%

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
decided to call Oprah I told her that I
 

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
decided to call Oprah I told her that I

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:19.089 align:start position:0%
wanted to up the ante and hold my breath
 

00:11:19.089 --> 00:11:21.530 align:start position:0%
wanted to up the ante and hold my breath
longer<00:11:19.690><c> than</c><00:11:20.020><c> any</c><00:11:20.200><c> human</c><00:11:20.680><c> being</c><00:11:20.710><c> ever</c><00:11:21.130><c> had</c>

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
longer than any human being ever had
this<00:11:22.540><c> was</c><00:11:22.750><c> a</c><00:11:22.779><c> different</c><00:11:23.290><c> record</c><00:11:23.500><c> this</c><00:11:23.920><c> is</c><00:11:24.100><c> a</c>

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.130 align:start position:0%
this was a different record this is a
 

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.030 align:start position:0%
this was a different record this is a
pure<00:11:24.550><c> o2</c><00:11:24.730><c> static</c><00:11:25.660><c> apnea</c><00:11:25.870><c> record</c><00:11:26.529><c> the</c><00:11:26.680><c> guinness</c>

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
pure o2 static apnea record the guinness
 

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
pure o2 static apnea record the guinness
had<00:11:27.460><c> set</c><00:11:27.700><c> the</c><00:11:27.880><c> world</c><00:11:28.120><c> record</c><00:11:28.330><c> at</c><00:11:28.630><c> 13</c><00:11:29.170><c> minutes</c>

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:30.930 align:start position:0%
had set the world record at 13 minutes
 

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.190 align:start position:0%
had set the world record at 13 minutes
so<00:11:31.930><c> basically</c><00:11:32.410><c> you</c><00:11:32.620><c> breathe</c><00:11:32.920><c> pure</c><00:11:33.310><c> o2</c><00:11:33.460><c> first</c>

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
so basically you breathe pure o2 first
 

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
so basically you breathe pure o2 first
oxygenating<00:11:35.200><c> your</c><00:11:35.320><c> body</c><00:11:35.500><c> flushing</c><00:11:36.040><c> out</c><00:11:36.190><c> co2</c>

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:36.490 align:start position:0%
oxygenating your body flushing out co2
 

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
oxygenating your body flushing out co2
and<00:11:37.120><c> you're</c><00:11:37.390><c> able</c><00:11:37.720><c> to</c><00:11:37.810><c> hold</c><00:11:38.020><c> much</c><00:11:38.380><c> longer</c><00:11:38.410><c> I</c>

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:40.529 align:start position:0%
and you're able to hold much longer I
 

00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:44.130 align:start position:0%
and you're able to hold much longer I
realized<00:11:41.529><c> that</c><00:11:42.460><c> my</c><00:11:42.700><c> real</c><00:11:42.839><c> competition</c><00:11:43.839><c> was</c>

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:44.140 align:start position:0%
realized that my real competition was

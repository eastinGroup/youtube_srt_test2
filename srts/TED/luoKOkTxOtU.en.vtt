00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
of the movie and you know the way to
achieving<00:03:31.150><c> it</c><00:03:31.420><c> was</c><00:03:31.540><c> simply</c><00:03:32.050><c> take</c><00:03:32.920><c> a</c><00:03:32.950><c> model</c>

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 align:start position:0%
achieving it was simply take a model
 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.010 align:start position:0%
achieving it was simply take a model
throat<00:03:33.790><c> out</c><00:03:33.940><c> of</c><00:03:34.030><c> a</c><00:03:34.090><c> helicopter</c><00:03:34.420><c> and</c><00:03:34.660><c> shoot</c><00:03:34.870><c> it</c>

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 align:start position:0%
throat out of a helicopter and shoot it
 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
throat out of a helicopter and shoot it
and<00:03:35.580><c> that's</c><00:03:36.580><c> simply</c><00:03:36.910><c> what</c><00:03:37.120><c> I</c><00:03:37.180><c> did</c><00:03:37.390><c> that's</c><00:03:37.750><c> me</c>

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 align:start position:0%
and that's simply what I did that's me
 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
and that's simply what I did that's me
shooting<00:03:38.320><c> and</c><00:03:38.470><c> I'm</c><00:03:38.530><c> a</c><00:03:38.560><c> fairly</c><00:03:38.920><c> mediocre</c>

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 align:start position:0%

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 align:start position:0%
brought him in here and you need to
 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
brought him in here and you need to
really<00:04:26.169><c> a</c><00:04:26.290><c> check</c><00:04:26.860><c> and</c><00:04:27.010><c> see</c><00:04:27.190><c> what</c><00:04:27.430><c> we</c><00:04:27.790><c> were</c>

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:12.730 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to explore and use and
 

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to explore and use and
it<00:09:13.120><c> caused</c><00:09:13.330><c> me</c><00:09:13.480><c> to</c><00:09:13.630><c> create</c><00:09:13.840><c> the</c><00:09:14.020><c> next</c><00:09:14.260><c> effect</c>

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:14.350 align:start position:0%
it caused me to create the next effect
 

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.190 align:start position:0%
it caused me to create the next effect
that<00:09:14.710><c> I'll</c><00:09:14.800><c> show</c><00:09:14.980><c> you</c><00:09:15.040><c> which</c><00:09:15.370><c> is</c><00:09:15.720><c> this</c><00:09:16.720><c> sort</c><00:09:17.140><c> of</c>

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
that I'll show you which is this sort of
 

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.990 align:start position:0%
that I'll show you which is this sort of
magic<00:09:17.620><c> transition</c><00:09:18.190><c> and</c><00:09:18.400><c> all</c><00:09:18.490><c> I</c><00:09:18.520><c> was</c><00:09:18.760><c> really</c>

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
magic transition and all I was really
 

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.390 align:start position:0%
magic transition and all I was really
attempting<00:09:19.510><c> to</c><00:09:19.600><c> do</c><00:09:19.720><c> is</c><00:09:19.960><c> basically</c><00:09:20.620><c> have</c><00:09:21.010><c> the</c>

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
attempting to do is basically have the
 

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
attempting to do is basically have the
audience<00:09:21.820><c> cue</c><00:09:22.270><c> the</c><00:09:22.510><c> effect</c><00:09:22.900><c> so</c><00:09:23.170><c> it</c><00:09:23.350><c> became</c><00:09:23.650><c> a</c>

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:23.710 align:start position:0%
audience cue the effect so it became a
 

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.130 align:start position:0%
audience cue the effect so it became a
seamless<00:09:24.280><c> experience</c><00:09:24.940><c> for</c><00:09:25.150><c> them</c><00:09:25.300><c> that</c><00:09:25.870><c> I</c>

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:26.140 align:start position:0%
seamless experience for them that I
 

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.570 align:start position:0%
seamless experience for them that I
wasn't<00:09:26.440><c> showing</c><00:09:26.800><c> you</c><00:09:26.980><c> my</c><00:09:27.220><c> sort</c><00:09:27.520><c> of</c>

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:27.580 align:start position:0%
wasn't showing you my sort of
 

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
wasn't showing you my sort of
interpretation<00:09:28.030><c> I</c><00:09:28.240><c> was</c><00:09:28.360><c> showing</c><00:09:28.540><c> what</c><00:09:28.750><c> you</c>

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:28.990 align:start position:0%
interpretation I was showing what you
 

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.130 align:start position:0%
interpretation I was showing what you
wanted<00:09:29.350><c> to</c><00:09:29.470><c> see</c><00:09:29.740><c> and</c><00:09:30.510><c> the</c><00:09:31.510><c> very</c><00:09:31.690><c> next</c><00:09:31.870><c> shot</c>

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:32.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to see and the very next shot
 

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.990 align:start position:0%
wanted to see and the very next shot
right<00:09:32.380><c> after</c><00:09:32.650><c> this</c>

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.490 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:09:38.000><c> you</c><00:09:38.060><c> can</c><00:09:38.240><c> see</c><00:09:38.390><c> what</c><00:09:38.780><c> I</c><00:09:38.810><c> was</c><00:09:38.990><c> doing</c><00:09:39.170><c> it</c><00:09:39.290><c> so</c>

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:39.500 align:start position:0%
so you can see what I was doing it so
 

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.810 align:start position:0%
so you can see what I was doing it so
basically<00:09:39.800><c> if</c><00:09:40.010><c> there's</c><00:09:40.130><c> two</c><00:09:40.280><c> subs</c><00:09:40.580><c> in</c><00:09:40.760><c> the</c>

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:40.820 align:start position:0%
basically if there's two subs in the
 

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.610 align:start position:0%
basically if there's two subs in the
same<00:09:41.030><c> shot</c><00:09:41.210><c> I</c><00:09:41.420><c> shot</c><00:09:41.450><c> it</c><00:09:41.810><c> because</c><00:09:41.960><c> where's</c><00:09:42.470><c> the</c>

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:42.620 align:start position:0%
same shot I shot it because where's the
 

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.860 align:start position:0%
same shot I shot it because where's the
camera<00:09:42.890><c> coming</c><00:09:43.100><c> from</c><00:09:43.310><c> and</c><00:09:44.120><c> when</c><00:09:44.330><c> Jim</c><00:09:44.480><c> shot</c><00:09:44.720><c> it</c>

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:44.870 align:start position:0%
camera coming from and when Jim shot it
 

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
camera coming from and when Jim shot it
was<00:09:45.050><c> only</c><00:09:45.170><c> one</c><00:09:45.380><c> sub</c><00:09:45.620><c> because</c><00:09:45.740><c> he</c><00:09:45.890><c> was</c>

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.010 align:start position:0%
was only one sub because he was
 

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
was only one sub because he was
photographed<00:09:46.400><c> from</c><00:09:46.490><c> another</c><00:09:46.700><c> and</c><00:09:46.880><c> I</c><00:09:46.910><c> don't</c>

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:46.970 align:start position:0%
photographed from another and I don't
 

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.490 align:start position:0%
photographed from another and I don't

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:48.500 align:start position:0%
remember if I did this or Jim did this
 

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.830 align:start position:0%
remember if I did this or Jim did this
I'll<00:09:48.710><c> give</c><00:09:48.860><c> it</c><00:09:48.950><c> to</c><00:09:48.980><c> Jim</c><00:09:49.250><c> cuz</c><00:09:49.490><c> he</c><00:09:50.270><c> could</c><00:09:50.450><c> use</c><00:09:50.630><c> the</c>

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
I'll give it to Jim cuz he could use the
 

00:09:50.840 --> 00:10:00.220 align:start position:0%
I'll give it to Jim cuz he could use the
pat<00:09:51.410><c> on</c><00:09:51.530><c> the</c><00:09:51.560><c> back</c><00:09:57.640><c> okay</c><00:09:58.640><c> so</c><00:09:59.330><c> now</c><00:09:59.510><c> the</c><00:09:59.570><c> Titanic</c>

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.230 align:start position:0%
pat on the back okay so now the Titanic
 

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.300 align:start position:0%
pat on the back okay so now the Titanic
transition<00:10:00.680><c> so</c><00:10:00.800><c> this</c><00:10:00.920><c> is</c><00:10:01.040><c> what</c><00:10:01.130><c> I</c><00:10:01.220><c> was</c>

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:01.310 align:start position:0%
transition so this is what I was
 

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
transition so this is what I was
referring<00:10:01.460><c> to</c><00:10:01.790><c> where</c><00:10:02.540><c> I</c><00:10:02.570><c> wanted</c><00:10:03.170><c> to</c><00:10:03.320><c> basically</c>

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:03.530 align:start position:0%
referring to where I wanted to basically
 

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.950 align:start position:0%
referring to where I wanted to basically
magically<00:10:04.340><c> transplant</c><00:10:04.970><c> from</c><00:10:05.150><c> one</c><00:10:05.390><c> state</c><00:10:05.720><c> of</c>

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
magically transplant from one state of
 

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.420 align:start position:0%
magically transplant from one state of
the<00:10:06.200><c> Titanic</c><00:10:06.770><c> to</c><00:10:06.800><c> the</c><00:10:06.950><c> other</c>

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:07.430 align:start position:0%
the Titanic to the other
 

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
the Titanic to the other
so<00:10:07.670><c> I'll</c><00:10:07.970><c> just</c><00:10:08.090><c> play</c><00:10:08.210><c> the</c><00:10:08.390><c> shot</c><00:10:08.570><c> once</c>

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:13.650 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.290 align:start position:0%
 
and<00:10:14.100><c> while</c><00:10:14.370><c> I</c><00:10:14.400><c> was</c><00:10:14.520><c> hoping</c><00:10:14.760><c> for</c><00:10:14.820><c> is</c><00:10:15.029><c> it</c><00:10:15.150><c> just</c>

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
and while I was hoping for is it just
 

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
and while I was hoping for is it just
melts<00:10:15.630><c> in</c><00:10:15.720><c> front</c><00:10:15.960><c> of</c><00:10:16.020><c> you</c>

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.180 align:start position:0%
 
that<00:10:25.790><c> was</c><00:10:25.970><c> the</c><00:10:26.150><c> last</c><00:10:26.330><c> time</c><00:10:26.720><c> Titanic</c><00:10:27.590><c> ever</c><00:10:27.860><c> saw</c>

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.190 align:start position:0%
that was the last time Titanic ever saw
 

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.020 align:start position:0%
that was the last time Titanic ever saw
daylight<00:10:29.020><c> so</c><00:10:30.020><c> um</c><00:10:30.320><c> what</c><00:10:30.890><c> I</c><00:10:30.920><c> did</c><00:10:31.160><c> is</c><00:10:31.640><c> basically</c>

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.030 align:start position:0%
daylight so um what I did is basically
 

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.220 align:start position:0%
daylight so um what I did is basically
had<00:10:32.210><c> another</c><00:10:32.420><c> screening</c><00:10:32.720><c> room</c><00:10:32.900><c> experience</c>

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:33.230 align:start position:0%
had another screening room experience
 

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.890 align:start position:0%
had another screening room experience
where<00:10:33.650><c> I</c><00:10:34.010><c> was</c><00:10:34.370><c> basically</c><00:10:34.730><c> tracking</c><00:10:35.390><c> where</c><00:10:35.540><c> I</c>

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:35.900 align:start position:0%
where I was basically tracking where I

people on the on the bow of the ship and
then<00:10:41.300><c> at</c><00:10:41.450><c> some</c><00:10:41.750><c> point</c><00:10:42.050><c> I'm</c><00:10:42.290><c> changing</c><00:10:42.800><c> the</c>

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:42.860 align:start position:0%
then at some point I'm changing the
 

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
then at some point I'm changing the

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.800 align:start position:0%

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.450 align:start position:0%

do and particularly on our stage because
 

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
do and particularly on our stage because
there<00:12:03.050><c> literally</c><00:12:03.439><c> is</c><00:12:03.649><c> no</c><00:12:03.680><c> way</c><00:12:04.100><c> to</c><00:12:04.160><c> actually</c>

00:12:08.199 --> 00:12:08.209 align:start position:0%
move this train because it's it fits so
 

00:12:08.209 --> 00:12:10.119 align:start position:0%
move this train because it's it fits so
snuggling<00:12:08.779><c> into</c><00:12:08.990><c> our</c><00:12:09.139><c> set</c><00:12:09.410><c> so</c><00:12:09.769><c> let</c><00:12:09.889><c> me</c><00:12:09.949><c> show</c>

00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:10.129 align:start position:0%
snuggling into our set so let me show
 

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:12.490 align:start position:0%
snuggling into our set so let me show
you<00:12:10.220><c> the</c><00:12:10.339><c> scene</c><00:12:10.579><c> and</c><00:12:10.879><c> then</c><00:12:11.629><c> I</c><00:12:11.660><c> basically</c><00:12:12.139><c> used</c>

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:12.500 align:start position:0%
you the scene and then I basically used
 

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.550 align:start position:0%
you the scene and then I basically used
the<00:12:12.680><c> trick</c><00:12:13.069><c> that</c><00:12:13.850><c> was</c><00:12:14.180><c> identified</c><00:12:15.019><c> by</c><00:12:15.050><c> Sergei</c>

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
the trick that was identified by Sergei
 

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.980 align:start position:0%
the trick that was identified by Sergei
Eisenstein<00:12:16.189><c> which</c><00:12:16.550><c> is</c><00:12:16.759><c> if</c><00:12:17.149><c> you</c><00:12:17.420><c> have</c><00:12:17.600><c> a</c><00:12:17.629><c> camera</c>

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
Eisenstein which is if you have a camera
 

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.259 align:start position:0%
Eisenstein which is if you have a camera
that's<00:12:18.290><c> moving</c><00:12:18.589><c> with</c><00:12:18.889><c> a</c><00:12:18.920><c> moving</c><00:12:19.279><c> object</c><00:12:19.399><c> what</c>

00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:20.269 align:start position:0%
that's moving with a moving object what
 

00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:21.879 align:start position:0%
that's moving with a moving object what
is<00:12:20.389><c> not</c><00:12:20.569><c> moving</c><00:12:20.870><c> appears</c><00:12:21.290><c> to</c><00:12:21.410><c> be</c><00:12:21.500><c> moving</c><00:12:21.800><c> at</c>

00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:21.889 align:start position:0%
is not moving appears to be moving at
 

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
is not moving appears to be moving at
what<00:12:22.009><c> is</c><00:12:22.129><c> moving</c><00:12:22.370><c> appears</c><00:12:22.759><c> to</c><00:12:22.879><c> be</c><00:12:23.000><c> stopped</c><00:12:23.240><c> so</c>

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.050 align:start position:0%
what is moving appears to be stopped so
 

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
what is moving appears to be stopped so
what<00:12:24.350><c> you're</c><00:12:24.500><c> actually</c><00:12:24.680><c> seeing</c><00:12:25.100><c> now</c><00:12:25.399><c> is</c><00:12:25.670><c> the</c>

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:25.850 align:start position:0%
what you're actually seeing now is the
 

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.850 align:start position:0%
what you're actually seeing now is the
train<00:12:26.060><c> is</c><00:12:26.240><c> not</c><00:12:26.420><c> moving</c><00:12:26.750><c> at</c><00:12:27.170><c> all</c>

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:27.860 align:start position:0%
train is not moving at all
 

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.069 align:start position:0%
train is not moving at all
and<00:12:28.129><c> what</c><00:12:28.639><c> is</c><00:12:28.759><c> actually</c><00:12:29.180><c> moving</c><00:12:29.540><c> is</c><00:12:29.810><c> the</c><00:12:30.050><c> floor</c>

00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
and what is actually moving is the floor
 

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:34.569 align:start position:0%
and what is actually moving is the floor
so<00:12:33.079><c> this</c><00:12:33.290><c> is</c><00:12:33.439><c> the</c><00:12:33.680><c> shots</c><00:12:33.949><c> the</c><00:12:34.189><c> low</c><00:12:34.309><c> that's</c><00:12:34.490><c> a</c>

00:12:34.569 --> 00:12:34.579 align:start position:0%
so this is the shots the low that's a
 

00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:37.179 align:start position:0%
so this is the shots the low that's a
little<00:12:34.759><c> video</c><00:12:35.509><c> of</c><00:12:35.649><c> what</c><00:12:36.649><c> you're</c><00:12:36.800><c> looking</c><00:12:36.920><c> at</c>

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:37.189 align:start position:0%
little video of what you're looking at
 

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:38.559 align:start position:0%
little video of what you're looking at
there<00:12:37.430><c> which</c><00:12:37.610><c> is</c><00:12:37.730><c> our</c><00:12:37.850><c> little</c><00:12:38.089><c> test</c><00:12:38.329><c> so</c><00:12:38.480><c> that's</c>

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:38.569 align:start position:0%
there which is our little test so that's
 

00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:40.780 align:start position:0%
there which is our little test so that's
actually<00:12:38.779><c> what</c><00:12:39.079><c> you're</c><00:12:39.199><c> seeing</c><00:12:39.470><c> and</c><00:12:39.790><c> I</c>

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
actually what you're seeing and I
 

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:41.769 align:start position:0%
actually what you're seeing and I
thought<00:12:41.059><c> it</c><00:12:41.180><c> was</c><00:12:41.300><c> sort</c><00:12:41.449><c> of</c><00:12:41.480><c> an</c><00:12:41.600><c> interesting</c>

00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:41.779 align:start position:0%
thought it was sort of an interesting
 

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
thought it was sort of an interesting
thing<00:12:42.139><c> because</c><00:12:42.439><c> it</c><00:12:42.559><c> was</c><00:12:42.860><c> part</c><00:12:43.250><c> of</c><00:12:43.309><c> the</c><00:12:43.430><c> homage</c>

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:43.730 align:start position:0%
thing because it was part of the homage
 

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.420 align:start position:0%
thing because it was part of the homage
of<00:12:43.759><c> the</c><00:12:44.089><c> of</c><00:12:44.300><c> the</c><00:12:44.389><c> movie</c><00:12:44.720><c> itself</c><00:12:45.050><c> is</c><00:12:45.350><c> is</c><00:12:46.040><c> coming</c>

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:46.430 align:start position:0%
of the of the movie itself is is coming
 

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
of the of the movie itself is is coming
up<00:12:46.550><c> with</c><00:12:46.699><c> this</c><00:12:46.879><c> sort</c><00:12:47.449><c> of</c><00:12:47.509><c> genius</c><00:12:47.839><c> trick</c><00:12:48.259><c> which</c>

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
I can't because it was invented like in
 

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
I can't because it was invented like in
1910<00:12:52.759><c> or</c><00:12:52.790><c> something</c><00:12:53.209><c> like</c><00:12:53.300><c> that</c><00:12:53.360><c> is</c><00:12:53.839><c> I</c><00:12:54.730><c> told</c>

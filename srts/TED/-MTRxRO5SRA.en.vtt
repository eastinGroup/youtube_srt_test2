about<00:02:42.450><c> two</c><00:02:42.630><c> or</c><00:02:42.660><c> three</c><00:02:42.780><c> weeks</c><00:02:42.960><c> and</c><00:02:43.410><c> then</c><00:02:43.830><c> we</c><00:02:43.950><c> get</c>

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
about two or three weeks and then we get
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.060 align:start position:0%
about two or three weeks and then we get
a<00:02:44.100><c> test</c><00:02:44.370><c> and</c><00:02:44.700><c> on</c><00:02:45.390><c> that</c><00:02:45.630><c> test</c><00:02:45.900><c> maybe</c><00:02:46.380><c> I</c><00:02:46.530><c> get</c><00:02:47.040><c> a</c>

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 align:start position:0%
a test and on that test maybe I get a
 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
a test and on that test maybe I get a
75%<00:02:47.970><c> maybe</c><00:02:48.750><c> you</c><00:02:48.960><c> get</c><00:02:49.110><c> a</c><00:02:49.170><c> 90%</c><00:02:49.650><c> maybe</c><00:02:50.040><c> you</c><00:02:50.280><c> get</c><00:02:50.430><c> a</c>

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 align:start position:0%
75% maybe you get a 90% maybe you get a
 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.150 align:start position:0%

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 align:start position:0%

build on those gaps it might be

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 align:start position:0%
wall and it's not because algebra is
 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.150 align:start position:0%
wall and it's not because algebra is
fundamentally<00:03:29.760><c> difficult</c><00:03:30.209><c> or</c><00:03:30.709><c> because</c><00:03:31.709><c> of</c>

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
the student isn't bright it's because
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.650 align:start position:0%
the student isn't bright it's because
I'm<00:03:35.190><c> seeing</c><00:03:35.400><c> an</c><00:03:35.580><c> equation</c><00:03:35.880><c> and</c><00:03:36.270><c> they're</c>

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't know it is showing up and then
 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.250 align:start position:0%
I didn't know it is showing up and then
I<00:03:41.250><c> start</c><00:03:41.910><c> and</c><00:03:42.090><c> then</c><00:03:42.300><c> I</c><00:03:42.330><c> start</c><00:03:42.660><c> to</c><00:03:42.810><c> disengage</c>

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
I start and then I start to disengage
 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.449 align:start position:0%
I start and then I start to disengage
and<00:03:43.640><c> to</c><00:03:44.640><c> appreciate</c><00:03:44.910><c> how</c><00:03:45.810><c> how</c><00:03:46.620><c> absurd</c><00:03:47.040><c> that</c><00:03:47.250><c> is</c>

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 align:start position:0%
and to appreciate how how absurd that is
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
and to appreciate how how absurd that is
imagine<00:03:48.360><c> if</c><00:03:48.420><c> we</c><00:03:48.570><c> did</c><00:03:48.690><c> other</c><00:03:48.870><c> things</c><00:03:49.140><c> in</c><00:03:49.320><c> our</c>

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 align:start position:0%
imagine if we did other things in our

imagine if we did other things in our

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 align:start position:0%
so we bring in the contractor say told
 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
so we bring in the contractor say told
we<00:04:00.720><c> have</c><00:04:00.810><c> two</c><00:04:00.990><c> weeks</c><00:04:01.140><c> to</c><00:04:01.350><c> build</c><00:04:01.470><c> a</c><00:04:01.620><c> foundation</c>

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 align:start position:0%
we have two weeks to build a foundation

we have two weeks to build a foundation
do<00:04:03.090><c> what</c><00:04:03.210><c> you</c><00:04:03.330><c> can</c><00:04:06.080><c> so</c><00:04:07.080><c> they</c><00:04:07.230><c> they</c><00:04:07.620><c> do</c><00:04:07.680><c> what</c>

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
do what you can so they they do what
 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
do what you can so they they do what
they<00:04:08.040><c> can</c><00:04:08.280><c> maybe</c><00:04:09.030><c> it</c><00:04:09.210><c> rains</c><00:04:09.480><c> maybe</c><00:04:09.960><c> some</c><00:04:10.170><c> of</c>

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 align:start position:0%
they can maybe it rains maybe some of

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:42.340 align:start position:0%
collection what you see is what you get
 

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.070 align:start position:0%

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.080 align:start position:0%

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:48.430 align:start position:0%
it's in the art collection it might be a

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:53.830 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting but we are

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%

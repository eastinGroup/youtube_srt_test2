00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:04.030 align:start position:0%
so we actually are doing some more
 

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
so we actually are doing some more

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:05.470 align:start position:0%

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.010 align:start position:0%

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
approach work even better
 

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.990 align:start position:0%

and I think that's one of the reasons
 

00:15:15.459 --> 00:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that's one of the reasons

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:17.290 align:start position:0%
why I fight so hard and I work so hard
 

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
why I fight so hard and I work so hard
is<00:15:17.709><c> because</c><00:15:17.950><c> I</c><00:15:18.280><c> was</c><00:15:18.400><c> really</c><00:15:18.760><c> really</c><00:15:18.910><c> really</c>

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.080
[Applause]

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.050
 turn

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.270
 we are living in a historical moment marked by a difficult style we know

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.600
 the world is shaken by the crisis caused by the pandemic of the expert name that

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.940
 highlights even more another global challenge the socio crisis

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.350
 environmental this places us all in front of the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:56.360
 need for a choice the choice between what matters and what doesn't

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.350
 the choice between continuing to ignore the sufferings of the poorest and to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.600
 mistreat our common home the earth or commit ourselves at every level

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:22.350
 to transform the way we act science tells us every day with more

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.009
 precision that it is necessary to act urgently and I am not exaggerating this says it

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.580
 science if we are to have a hope of avoiding climate change

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.970
 among which and catastrophic and for this to act knowledge this is a given

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.920
 scientific know the conscience tells us that we can not be

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.009
 indifferent to the suffering of the poorest to the growing ones

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:04.020
 economic inequalities and social injustices and the economy itself

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.970
 can not be limited to production and distribution must consider

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.090
 necessarily its impact on the environment and the dignity of the person

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:29.780
 we could say that the economy must be creative

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.819
 it in its methods in the way of acting creativity limit yourself to undertake

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.930
 together a journey a journey of transformation and action not done

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:55.330
 so much of words but above all of concrete and urgent actions

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.360
 we think about travel because it requires a shift, a change from it

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.600
 crisis none of us must come out the same not

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:16.660
 it can come out the same from a crisis, never comes out the same and it will take time and effort

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.069
 to get out of it it will be necessary to go step by step to help the weak persuade i

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:32.080
 doubters imagine new solutions and commit to carry them forward but

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.350
 the goal is clear to build over the next decade

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.950
 a world where the needs of the present generations can be met

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:56.700
 including everyone without compromising the possibilities of future generations

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.769
 I would like to invite all people of Christian faith or not

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:12.160
 and all people of good will to embark on this journey from his

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.959
 faith or if he does not have faith from his will in his own good will

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.460
 each each of us as individuals and members of family groups

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.060
 faith communities enterprises associations institutions and can make a contribution

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.660
 significant

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.870
 five years ago I wrote the encyclical letter laudato be dedicated to care

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.309
 of our common home proposes the concept of integral ecology for

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:54.479
 respond together to the cry of the earth but also to the cry of the poor

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:01.659
 integral ecology and an invitation to an integral vision of life to leave

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:09.610
 from the belief that everything in the world is connected and that as the

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.259
 pandemic we are interdependent on each other

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:23.259
 others and even dependent on our mother earth from such a vision

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:30.460
 the need to seek other ways of understanding progress and measuring it

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:38.770
 without limiting ourselves to the economic technological and financial dimension of al

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:46.930
 gross product but giving a central importance to the social dimensions and type

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:55.349
 and educational activities, today I would like to propose three courses of action

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.669
 as written in laudato be the change and the right orientation for

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:10.449
 the journey of ecology and integral requires you to take a step first

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.529
 educational type

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:20.080
 therefore the first proposal is to promote at every level

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.459
 an education in the care of the common home by developing an understanding that i

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:34.899
 environmental problems are related to human needs we must understand

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:43.160
 this from the beginning environmental problems are linked to human needs

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:51.440
 an education based on scientific data and an ethical approach

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:58.349
 I am heartened by the fact that many young people already have this important

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:05.520
 a new ecological and social sensitivity and some of them are fighting in such a way

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.349
 generous for the defense of the environment and for justice as a second proposal

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:22.050
 more emphasis needs to be placed on water and nutrition access to water

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:31.400
 safe drinking and a universal and essential human and social right

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.669
 because it determines the survival of people and therefore the conditions for

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:44.159
 the exercise of any other right and responsibility to ensure

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:50.370
 adequate nutrition for all through non farming methods

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:57.210
 destructive should then become the fundamental purpose of the entire cycle of

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:06.060
 production and distribution of food the third proposal is that of

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:14.699
 energy transition a gradual but immediate replacement of

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:19.580
 fossil fuels with clean energy sources

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:25.919
 we have a few years the scientists calculate to proceed

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:34.830
 approximately less than 30 we have a few years less than 30

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:41.750
 to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:48.270
 this transition must be not only rapid and able to satisfy needs

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:56.700
 of present and future energy but also must be attentive to the impacts on

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.780
 poor on local populations and on those who work in the production sectors

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.380
 of energy a way to encourage this change

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.660
 and to lead businesses towards the urgent need for

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:19.590
 commit to the integral care of the common home by excluding from

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.820
 investments companies that do not meet i

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:29.930
 integral vestments of ecology and rewarding those who work

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:35.460
 concretely in this transition phase to place at the center of

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:43.110
 their activities parameters such as sustainability, social justice and

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:48.810
 promotion of the common good many Catholic and other organizations

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:55.770
 other faiths have already taken on the responsibility of working in this

00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:04.020
 direction in fact the land must be worked and cared for, cultivated and protected

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:14.070
 we can't keep squeezing like an orange and we can say this

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:19.580
 looking after the land is a human right

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:27.840
 these three proposals go intense as part of a large set of actions that

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.900
 we must carry on in an integrated way to arrive at a solution

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:39.390
 lasting problems the current economic system is

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:45.120
 unsustainable we are faced with the moral imperative e

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:54.230
 the practical urge to rethink many things how we produce how we consume

00:10:54.230 --> 00:11:00.540
 think our culture of waste the short-term vision it

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.370
 exploitation of the poor indifference towards them

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:13.340
 the increase in inequalities and the dependence on energy sources from

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:21.930
 our challenges but we must think integral ecology suggests one

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:29.310
 new concession of the relationship between us with nature this brings a new one

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.970
 economy in which the production of wealth is directed towards well-being

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:42.390
 integral of the human being and the improvement not the destruction of

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:50.820
 our common home also means a renewed policy conceived as one

00:11:50.820 --> 00:12:03.030
 of the highest forms of charity yes interpersonal love but also

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:11.960
 love and politics envelops all peoples involves nature

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:19.230
 I therefore invite everyone and everyone to undertake this trip I recommend

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:27.000
 proposed in the laudato SÃ¬ and also in the new encyclical Brothers All Like

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.980
 suggests the term amnesty we must urgently act each of

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:41.990
 we can play a valuable role if we all get on the road

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.410
 today not tomorrow today

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:56.379
 because the future is built today and not built alone but in community

00:12:56.379 --> 00:13:04.540
 and in harmony thanks [Music]

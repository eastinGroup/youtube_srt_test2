00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.189
I am a journalist and I am an immigrant and these two conditions define me

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.119
 I was born in Mexico but more than half of my life has been reported in the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.300
 united states a country created precisely by immigrants and as

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.420
 reporter and as a foreigner I have learned that neutrality

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.210
 Silence and fear are not the best options for journalism and for the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.050
 life neutrality is often a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.280
 excuse journalists use to hide in our true

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.059
 responsibility and what is that responsibility

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.300
 questioning and challenging those in power that is what journalism is for

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.549
 the great wonder of journalism questions and defies the powerful

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.030
 of course we have the obligation to report reality as it is not

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 as we would like it to be in this sense, I agree with the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.420
 principle of objectivity and a house is blue

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.439
 I say it's blue if there are a million unemployed said there are a million but

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.479
 neutrality is not necessarily going to lead me to the truth even if it is

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.530
 rigorously scrupulous and I presented to you the two parts of a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.780
 liberal and conservative democrat and republican news

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.090
 the government and the opposition in the end that does not guarantee me nor does it guarantee us that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.869
 let's know what is true and what is not true

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.680
 life is much more complex and I think journalism should reflect

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.540
 precisely that complexity let me tell you one thing I refuse

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.939
 make a tape recorder I did not become a journalist to make a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.200
 tape recorder well I know what they are going to tell me nobody uses tape recorders in days

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.330
 So I refuse to take out my cell phone and hit the record button and point it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.970
 in front of me like they were a concert like a fan in a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.990
 concert this is not true journalism

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.060
 Contrary to what many journalists think, all the time we are

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.180
 making value judgments ethical and moral judgments and we are always making

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.970
 highly personal and extraordinarily subjective decisions by

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.220
 For example, what happens if you have to cover a dictatorship like that of August Pinochet in

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.360
 Chile or Fidel Castro's in Cuba will report only what he wanted in general and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.050
 the commander or you are going to face them, what happens if you find out that in your country

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.910
 or in the next country students are disappearing and

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.590
 clandestine graves appearing or millions disappearing the budget and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.020
 magically appearing billionaire ex-presidents you're going to just give the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:18.480
 official version or what happens if you have to cover the presidential elections of

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.670
 the main superpower and one of the candidates makes racist comments

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:34.860
 sexist and xenophobic that happened to me and I want to tell you what I did

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.269
 but before explaining where I come from so that they understand what my reaction was

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.810
 What if in Mexico City about the oldest of five brothers and the truth that

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.350
 There was not enough money in the house to pay all the school fees.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.670
 university so I studied in the mornings and worked in the afternoons and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.670
 after a long time they gave me a job that a reporter has always looked for

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.110
 television was a great opportunity but in my third report I was

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.560
 happened to criticize the president and question the lack of democracy in

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.140
 Mexico from 1929 to 2000 in Mexico there was pure fraud

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.049
 the president in turn chose by finger his successor and that was not a

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.440
 true democracy seems like a great idea to me

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.919
 reporting my boss to my boss did not seem so

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.350
 great at that time there was a direct censorship

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.400
 from the presidential house of los pinos to the media and my

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.300
 boss who besides being in charge of the program and that I also worked

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.460
 He was in charge of a soccer team and I always suspected that they interested him

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.560
 plus the goals and the news censored my report asked me to

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.410
 will change I said no and then he put another

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:01.070
 journalist to write what I was supposed to say I did not want

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.320
 being a censored journalist I don't know where I got the strength to write my

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.340
 letter of resignation and thus at 24 years of age only 24 make the decision more

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.389
 difficult and momentous of my life not only was I going to give up television

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:23.150
 but I had decided to leave my country I sold my little boy was a ramshackle

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.990
 red volkswagen get the dollars and i said goodbye to my friends family

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:36.440
 of my streets in my five goals from mista jos and bought a one-way ticket

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.400
 to Los Angeles California so I became one of the 250

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.860
 millions of immigrants around the world

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.550
 ask any migrant about the first day when they arrive at that new

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.479
 country and they will see how they remember absolutely everything as if it were a

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.800
 film with background music in my case I arrived in Los Angeles on

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.080
 sun was setting and all i had a guitar a weed and some

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.190
 documents I could carry everything with my two hands

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.740
 I have not felt that feeling of absolute freedom again and survive with what

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.830
 what I had with the little I had to get a student visa was

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:26.120
 studying I ate a lot of lettuce and pal because there was no more and finally in 1984

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.300
 I got my first job as a television reporter in the states

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.370
 united and the first thing I noticed is that my colleagues in the United States

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.240
 they criticized and very hard the president in turn ronald regan and it did not happen

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:52.000
 absolutely nothing, nobody censored it, I thought it was discontinuous, and that's how it has been

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.039
 for more than 30 years reporting with absolute freedom and if the treaty as

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:03.289
 an equal despite being an immigrant until suddenly I had to cover the

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:11.349
 past presidential elections in the united states on june 16, 2015

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:15.289
 a candidate who would eventually become president of the states

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:22.930
 Unidos said Mexican immigrants were criminals

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.360
 drug dealers rapists and I knew he was lying

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.629
 I knew he was wrong for a simple reason I am an immigrant

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:38.060
 Mexican and we are not like that in such a way that I did what any other reporter

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:45.050
 I would have written him a handwritten letter, requesting an interview and

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.539
 he sent the letter to his new york tower the next day he was already at the office and

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:54.379
 soon he begins to receive hundreds of calls and texts to my phone

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:57.110
 some more insulting than others I don't

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.210
 I knew what was happening until a friend came to my office and told me

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:08.060
 they published a cell phone number on the internet, they were actually made here

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:14.870
 There is the letter that they sent that they put the cell phone neither do they write it down nor do they

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:20.779
 bother because they already change it but but I learned two things the first is that

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:28.300
 you should never never never give your donalson cell phone number

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:38.610
 and the second lesson is that I should stop being neutral at that moment

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.200
 from then on, my mission as a journalist changed. I was going to face the

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.620
 candidate and prove him wrong that it was not true what he

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.260
 said about immigrants in the United States

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.490
 let me give your details to 97 percent of all undocumented in the

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:58.200
 United States with new people less than 3 percent have committed a

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.279
 felony or felony and how they say it in English and in comparison 6 percent

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:05.460
 of Americans have committed a serious crime

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.620
 the bottom line is that undocumented immigrants behave much better

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.960
 than Americans with this data and if a plan eight

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.640
 weeks after I posted my cell phone or credited as

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.200
 journalist at a press conference of the candidate who would trace all the

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:33.030
 polls and decided to face him in person but things did not work out

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.670
 exactly as I had planned see

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:45.090
 [Music]

00:09:46.680 --> 00:10:02.680
 planet 51 says no that for the gospel

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:08.200
 you cannot and by and the vermillion type you cannot nineteen hundred malvo you

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:47.940
 cannot be nice systems &amp; your blessing of floors there are days that are no more

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.480
 it is

00:10:54.499 --> 00:10:56.679
 3

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.670
 After watching the video, the first thing I always think of is that the

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.420
 hatred is contagious if you look after the candidate

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.810
 Colgate and Univision tells me those are code words what it is telling me

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.430
 now get out of here one of his followers as if they had given permission

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.720
 He told me get out of my country without knowing that I

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.270
 I am also a citizen of the United States after watching this video many

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:32.740
 Sometimes I also think that to break neutrality and it is a true

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:39.160
 break up you have to lose your fear then learn to say no I'm not going to

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:45.010
 shut up I'm not going to sit down and I'm not going to go him

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:54.820
 he not he is not the most powerful word that exists in any language and

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.540
 always precedes any major change in our lives and I believe that

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.110
 there is enormous dignity and it generates a lot of respect

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:08.950
 the power to separate and resist and say no bezel the holocaust survivor

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:14.320
 and Nobel Peace Prize since we lost unfortunately very recently to say

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.670
 some very wise words said we must take sides

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.620
 neutrality only helps the oppressor never the victim is absolutely right

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.790
 journalists are obliged to take sides in certain circumstances

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:34.900
 in cases of racism, discrimination, corruption, public lies, dictatorships

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.730
 and human rights we must put aside neutrality and indifference

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:45.520
 In Spanish there is a beautiful word that describes where we should be standing

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.750
 journalists and the word is effectively counter-power to journalists graus

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:54.940
 be on the other side of where the powerful are but if you are involved in the

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.630
 bed with the politician if you go to the christening at the wedding of the

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.520
 governor if you want to be a friend of the president like the two to criticize

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.700
 when it's my turn to interview powerful or influential people, always

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.500
 think of two things that if I ask that difficult uncomfortable question no one else

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.140
 it will be and that I will never see that again

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:22.890
 person then I'm not looking or looking good and have to do in the end if

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.970
 I have to choose between being a friend or an enemy of the president is always

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:34.380
 preferable to be the enemy to finish I know that these are moments very

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:40.170
 difficult to become a migrant and a journalist but now more than ever

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:45.150
 they need journalists who are willing at any given moment to let

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.660
 aside neutrality personally I feel that I have prepared

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:55.290
 By this time all my life when I was censored at age 24 I learned that the

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.460
 neutrality fear and silence often become an accomplice

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:08.130
 crimes and abuses and injustices and being an accomplice of power never the good

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.690
 journalism now at 59 years old I just hope

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:19.080
 have a little bit of the courage and mental clarity that I had when I was 24 years old and

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:25.400
 so I will never be silent again, thank you very much

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.940
 and

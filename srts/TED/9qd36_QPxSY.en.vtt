00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
would do sleep deprivation experiments
 

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.290 align:start position:0%

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:43.300 align:start position:0%

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.730 align:start position:0%
on them on us and so I would come in and

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:44.740 align:start position:0%
take the test and you know I fell asleep
 

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
take the test and you know I fell asleep
in<00:11:45.100><c> each</c><00:11:45.220><c> one</c><00:11:45.430><c> and</c><00:11:45.670><c> that</c><00:11:46.630><c> was</c><00:11:46.839><c> because</c><00:11:47.170><c> again</c>

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:47.530 align:start position:0%
in each one and that was because again
 

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.810 align:start position:0%
in each one and that was because again
this<00:11:47.890><c> was</c><00:11:47.950><c> so</c><00:11:48.610><c> eventually</c><00:11:49.420><c> it</c><00:11:50.020><c> becomes</c><00:11:50.410><c> as</c>

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
this was so eventually it becomes as
 

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
this was so eventually it becomes as

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:57.490 align:start position:0%

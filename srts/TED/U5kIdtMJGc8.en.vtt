00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:49.300 align:start position:0%
year's worth of days and you you know
 

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
year's worth of days and you you know
you'd<00:10:49.839><c> make</c><00:10:50.520><c> a</c><00:10:51.520><c> little</c><00:10:51.700><c> money</c><00:10:51.880><c> during</c><00:10:52.270><c> that</c>

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:52.390 align:start position:0%
you'd make a little money during that
 

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.329 align:start position:0%
you'd make a little money during that

00:10:54.329 --> 00:10:54.339 align:start position:0%
period but so you would think it's a
 

00:10:54.339 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
period but so you would think it's a

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.250 align:start position:0%
very best digial system so you would
 

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
very best digial system so you would

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:58.930 align:start position:0%
test a bunch of different lengths of

test a bunch of different lengths of

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.670
what is love is a difficult term to define insofar as

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.320
 its application is very wide I can like jogging

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.170
 I can love a book a movie I can love a schnitzel I can love my

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.380
 women

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.640
 but there is a big difference between a schnitzel and my wife for example

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.600
 is that if I value the escalope the escalope on the other hand in return it does not

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.730
 don't value me when my wife calls me

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.300
 the star of his life only another desiring consciousness can

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.320
 to constitute as a desirable being that I know it and that is why we

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.090
 can define love more precisely as the desire to be

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.280
 longed for sweet the eternal problem of love

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:26.130
 how to become and how to remain desirable then the answer to this problem

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.180
 the individual found it formerly by subjecting his life to the rules of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.140
 community he had a specific role to play following

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.320
 his sex his age his social status he just had to hold him to be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.640
 valued and loved by its entire community

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.390
 think of the young girl who must remain chaste before marriage

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.250
 think of the younger son who owes obedience to the eldest son who himself owes

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.750
 obedience to the patriarch

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:06.480
 only here is a phenomenon that began from the thirteenth century but above all from

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.450
 the renaissance in the West which caused the greatest identity crisis

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.459
 of the history of mankind this phenomenon is modernity we can

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.320
 roughly summarize it by a threefold process first a process of

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.209
 rationalization of scientific research which accelerates progress

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.890
 technical then a process of democratization

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.580
 policy that developed the rights of the individual and finally a process of

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.510
 rationalization of economic production and liberalization of

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.799
 trade these three intertwined processes have

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.530
 completely destroyed all the traditional benchmarks of Western societies

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.170
 the consequence for the individual is radical, the individual is now free

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.770
 to value or devalue such an attitude

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:12.790
 such choices such and such an object but suddenly his person himself is confronted with this

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.600
 same freedom as for others to value it or to devalue it to say it

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.730
 otherwise my value formerly I assured it in me

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:34.470
 submitting to traditional authorities now it is publicly traded on

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.960
 in the free market of individual desires

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.740
 I negotiate my value every day, hence the anguish of contemporary man

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.970
 how desirable am I obsession

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.300
 how many people will love me and how does he respond to this anxiety

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.460
 hysterically accumulating the symbols of desirability

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.950
 this accumulation I call it with others the capital seduction it is on

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.030
 the capital of seduction which rests in large part in fact our society of

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.090
 consumption we say in this connection about consumption that our time and

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.430
 materialist but it is wrong if we accumulate objects it is for

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.320
 to communicate with other spirits is to make us love both

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.740
 seduce

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.510
 nothing less materialistic nothing more sentimental than a teenager who buys

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.120
 a brand new pair of jeans that rips her knee because he wants to please

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.600
 to jennifer

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.090
 consumerism is not materialism

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.940
 it is rather the engulfed matter sacrificed in the name of the god love or rather

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:09.550
 in the name of the capital seduction then from this observation on love

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.420
 current how to think about the love of future years

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.610
 we can consider two hypotheses the first is to bet on a

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:25.150
 accentuation of this process of narcissistic capitalization what form

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.930
 will take this accentuation, it is very hard to say because it depends on

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.280
 a large part of social and technical innovations which are not defined

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.860
 difficult to predict but one can for example imagine a website of

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.700
 encounter where a bit like with points this corn 1 we work with

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.760
 points capital seduction which varies according to my age my height to weight ratio

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.020
 diploma my salary or the number of clicks accumulated on my profile

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:09.160
 we can also imagine a chemical treatment of the breakup that

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.890
 weakens the feeling of attachment there is already a program on

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:21.910
 the mtv channel or teachers of seduction treat heartache

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.660
 like a disease these professors are called pick up artists so

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.000
 artists in French it's easy these artists and then pick-ups and lifting

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.700
 but not just any age lifting girl so they are lifting artists

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.690
 girl and they call they call the

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.800
 heartache one it is it is in English it is a suffix which means

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.940
 infections of which when it is one could translate its infections part of the unique

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.520
 it's not a little disgusting and in fact for the pick up artist to make a

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.920
 loving fixation on someone and well it's wasting time it's wasted

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.090
 its capital of seduction and therefore we must eliminate it like a disease like a

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:15.900
 infection we can still consider a use

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.300
 in love with the genomic map we have it we will carry it on everyone

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:27.840
 then we would show it as a business card to check if the seduction

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.850
 may not lead to reproduction

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:40.770
 so of course this race for seduction like any fierce competition

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.770
 will produce two great disparities in narcissistic satisfaction and therefore

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.370
 also a lot of loneliness a lot of frustration

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.460
 then we must expect that modernity itself which is at the origin

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.100
 capital seduction is called into question I am thinking in particular of reactions

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:08.400
 communitarian neo-fascist or religious type but hey, such a future is

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.810
 not inevitably another voice may be possible for

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:20.610
 think about love but how to give up the hysterical demand

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:27.680
 to be valued and well by becoming aware of my nullity

00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:36.820
 and yes I suck but don't worry too

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:47.540
 but if we are we are all zero it's quite easy to demonstrate

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:54.529
 this nullity since in order to be valued I ask the other to

00:08:54.529 --> 00:08:58.100
 wish therefore is that I have no value in myself I have no value

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.850
 in ourselves we all have

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:07.190
 well we all pretend to have an idol we all pretend to be an idol

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.190
 idol for someone but in fact we are all impostors and a little

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:15.110
 like the one who passes as an indifferent lord in the street when he has

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:21.860
 everything planned everything calculated so that all eyes are on him so I

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.399
 think that becoming aware of this of this general imposture that we

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.970
 concerns all those passive irene to love relationships it is because I

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.519
 want to be adored to the tips of my nails, justified in all my choices

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:39.740
 that there is a hysteria of seduction and suddenly I want to appear perfect for

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.550
 that the other even I want it to be perfect so that it reassures me about my

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:49.880
 value and this results in couples obsessed with performance and who will

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.760
 to quit precisely at the slightest negative performance, then the opposite of this

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.260
 attitude I invoke tenderness love as

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.880
 what tenderness what is tenderness being time to accept

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.670
 weaknesses of the loved one, but it is not a question of transforming into a

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:13.990
 sad couple to be caregivers 1 it's not terrible that there is on the contrary

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:18.459
 a lot of charm a lot of joy in the tenderness I think in particular a type

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:22.810
 of humor which unfortunately very little practiced and which is a kind of poetry of

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:27.970
 clumsiness assumed I think of self-mockery for a couple who is

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.170
 no longer maintained supported by the constraints of tradition I think

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.810
 self-mockery is one of the best ways to last

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.480

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 align:start position:0%
so um
 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.710 align:start position:0%

but<00:04:32.199><c> I</c><00:04:32.440><c> think</c><00:04:32.610><c> sometimes</c><00:04:33.610><c> cleverness</c><00:04:34.270><c> is</c><00:04:34.539><c> more</c>

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 align:start position:0%
this would be one of those instances so

ace

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:23.690
 look at me with that word I became a gaze trainer I'm the mom and they go

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.170
 15-year-old Ivan has autism, does not speak and is

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.850
 communicates through an ipad where his entire universe of words and images is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.930
 I received his diagnosis when I was two and a half years old and I still remember today

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.730
 that moment with a lot of pain with my husband we felt very lost

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.989
 we did not know where to start there was no internet as now you could not

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:09.009
 ignore information so these first steps were pure intuition

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.429
 iván did not hold the gaze he had lost the words he said no

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:22.069
 answered their name and nothing we did to them as if the words were

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.000
 noises

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:34.490
 the only way I had to know what was wrong with him what he felt was

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.390
 looking into his eyes

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:48.500
 that bridge was rock like showing him the villalba when he shared things that

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.020
 they liked així I did not look and we were together like this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.170
 that I dedicated myself to follow him in those things so that every time he unit more and more

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.880
 moments of gazes we spend hours and hours when he stains her with her sister

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.200
 Major Alexia and in this round of Haiti is

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.090
 rag was looking for me there at that moment I felt that I was

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:32.970
 river we also have a record now in the pool he always had a very passionate

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.720
 strong because of the water I remember that I was two and a half years old and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.660
 one winter day with lots of rain I was carrying a covered pool

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.989
 because even those days we were not there we were going down the highway and

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.319
 I made the wrong exit and there she started crying inconsolably without stopping until

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.849
 that I get back on the road and just then it calmed down, how was it possible that with two years

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.700
 and a half did not respond to its name but in the middle of this rain it is flour that

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.819
 he could not see anything he was able to perfectly recognize the path

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.100
 there I realized that they will have an exceptional visual memory and that this

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.819
 I was going to pass and the front door so I started taking pictures of everything and

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:40.799
 teaching him life continues to be shown from photo to photo and still today is

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:48.299
 the way they went tells us what he wants is what he needs and

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:56.600
 also what he always is but not only was the rival look

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.940
 [Music] was also the lives of others

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:09.389
 how to achieve that they not only look at the auc and added but that they look at him with

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:16.079
 all that he can give with all that he is capable of chance with the things that

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.650
 they like the ones that don't like any of us but for that I also had

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.280
 what to do on my part I had to encourage myself to let go and it cost me

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.210
 very much

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.480
 iván was 11 years old and this is a treatment very close to

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.890
 home in another neighborhood and one afternoon while

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.650
 I had been waiting for him for a long time at a greengrocery store in the neighborhood that

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.010
 He has a bit of everything and between purchases he likes to chat with josé g

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:02.860
 Contra iván's owner who had autism and that I wanted him to take care of her

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.250
 to walk alone down the street without anyone being the hand and I was encouraged to

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.740
 ask him if the garlic games the afternoon were going could he come to help the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.260
 order from the water bottle shelves because she loved to order and prize

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.160
 buy some chocolate cookies his favorite recipes

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.970
 He immediately said yes and that's how it was for a year

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.190
 iván would come to josé's greengrocer, help him to see the shelves of bottles

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.150
 of water that were left with the labels perfectly enchiladas

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.760
 millimetrically to the same side and left happy with his cookies from

00:05:48.760 --> 00:06:03.160
 chocolate plus josé is not an expert on autism you don't have to be an expert on

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:10.500
 nothing and be no feat to include out

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.600
 we just have to be

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.770
 more

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.580
 well it is no fault

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.600
 we just have to be close

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:45.800
 If something scares us or we don't understand it, let's ask, let's be curious, but never

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:57.060
 indifferent let us have the courage to look into each other's eyes because with our

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:05.240
 look we can open a world to another fact

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then I would kind of do this and
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.770 align:start position:0%
and then I would kind of do this and
that<00:00:48.170><c> would</c><00:00:49.170><c> happen</c><00:00:49.530><c> every</c><00:00:49.890><c> single</c><00:00:50.190><c> paper</c><00:00:50.780><c> but</c>

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 align:start position:0%
too big a project so I planned things
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.170 align:start position:0%
too big a project so I planned things
out<00:01:03.780><c> and</c><00:01:03.930><c> I</c><00:01:03.989><c> decided</c><00:01:04.049><c> I</c><00:01:04.589><c> kind</c><00:01:05.280><c> of</c><00:01:05.400><c> had</c><00:01:05.880><c> to</c><00:01:06.030><c> go</c>

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
out and I decided I kind of had to go
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 align:start position:0%
out and I decided I kind of had to go
something<00:01:06.479><c> like</c><00:01:06.570><c> this</c><00:01:06.860><c> this</c><00:01:07.860><c> is</c><00:01:07.920><c> how</c><00:01:08.100><c> the</c><00:01:08.159><c> year</c>

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 align:start position:0%
something like this this is how the year
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.570 align:start position:0%
something like this this is how the year
would<00:01:08.549><c> go</c><00:01:08.670><c> so</c><00:01:09.180><c> I'd</c><00:01:09.299><c> start</c><00:01:09.600><c> off</c><00:01:09.780><c> light</c><00:01:10.229><c> and</c><00:01:10.580><c> I'd</c>

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
would go so I'd start off light and I'd
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 align:start position:0%
would go so I'd start off light and I'd
bump<00:01:11.880><c> it</c><00:01:12.030><c> up</c><00:01:12.119><c> in</c><00:01:12.270><c> the</c><00:01:12.360><c> middle</c><00:01:12.450><c> months</c><00:01:12.840><c> and</c><00:01:13.049><c> then</c>

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
bump it up in the middle months and then
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.859 align:start position:0%
bump it up in the middle months and then
at<00:01:14.310><c> the</c><00:01:14.400><c> end</c><00:01:14.430><c> I</c><00:01:14.970><c> would</c><00:01:15.090><c> kick</c><00:01:15.390><c> it</c><00:01:15.509><c> up</c><00:01:15.600><c> into</c><00:01:15.750><c> high</c>

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 align:start position:0%
at the end I would kick it up into high
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.990 align:start position:0%
at the end I would kick it up into high
gear<00:01:15.900><c> stick</c><00:01:16.530><c> a</c><00:01:16.590><c> little</c><00:01:16.799><c> staircase</c><00:01:17.070><c> how</c><00:01:17.790><c> hard</c>

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 align:start position:0%
could it be just walk up the stairs no
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.410 align:start position:0%
could it be just walk up the stairs no
big<00:01:20.580><c> deal</c><00:01:20.759><c> right</c><00:01:22.280><c> but</c><00:01:23.280><c> then</c><00:01:23.549><c> funniest</c><00:01:24.270><c> thing</c>

happened those first few months they
came<00:01:27.090><c> and</c><00:01:27.240><c> went</c><00:01:27.420><c> and</c><00:01:27.570><c> I</c><00:01:27.659><c> couldn't</c><00:01:28.140><c> quite</c><00:01:28.259><c> do</c>

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
came and went and I couldn't quite do
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
came and went and I couldn't quite do
stuff<00:01:28.920><c> so</c><00:01:29.670><c> we</c><00:01:29.759><c> had</c><00:01:29.850><c> an</c><00:01:29.939><c> awesome</c><00:01:30.150><c> new</c><00:01:30.479><c> revised</c>

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 align:start position:0%
stuff so we had an awesome new revised
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.819 align:start position:0%
stuff so we had an awesome new revised
plan<00:01:31.759><c> and</c><00:01:32.759><c> then</c>

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 align:start position:0%
plan and then
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
plan and then
but<00:01:35.829><c> then</c><00:01:35.979><c> those</c><00:01:36.189><c> middle</c><00:01:36.610><c> months</c><00:01:36.909><c> actually</c>

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 align:start position:0%
but then those middle months actually
 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.899 align:start position:0%
but then those middle months actually
went<00:01:37.390><c> by</c><00:01:37.570><c> and</c><00:01:38.020><c> I</c><00:01:38.829><c> didn't</c><00:01:39.189><c> really</c><00:01:39.369><c> write</c><00:01:39.520><c> words</c>

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 align:start position:0%
went by and I didn't really write words
 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
went by and I didn't really write words
and<00:01:40.770><c> so</c><00:01:41.770><c> we</c><00:01:41.920><c> were</c><00:01:42.009><c> here</c><00:01:42.340><c> and</c><00:01:42.780><c> then</c><00:01:43.780><c> two</c><00:01:44.020><c> months</c>

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 align:start position:0%
and so we were here and then two months
 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.529 align:start position:0%
and so we were here and then two months
turned<00:01:44.860><c> into</c><00:01:45.009><c> one</c><00:01:45.280><c> month</c><00:01:45.520><c> she</c><00:01:46.180><c> turned</c><00:01:46.360><c> into</c>

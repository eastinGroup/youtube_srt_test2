this is something that through research
and<00:05:59.520><c> education</c><00:06:00.270><c> I</c><00:06:00.510><c> believe</c><00:06:00.810><c> that</c><00:06:01.710><c> we</c><00:06:01.830><c> can</c>

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
and education I believe that we can
 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:09.020 align:start position:0%
and education I believe that we can
solve<00:06:02.220><c> and</c><00:06:03.380><c> so</c><00:06:05.240><c> the</c><00:06:06.240><c> first</c><00:06:06.450><c> step</c><00:06:06.600><c> is</c><00:06:08.030><c> to</c>

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 align:start position:0%
solve and so the first step is to
 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.950 align:start position:0%
solve and so the first step is to
realize<00:06:09.480><c> that</c><00:06:10.850><c> we</c><00:06:11.850><c> can</c><00:06:12.090><c> do</c><00:06:12.210><c> this</c><00:06:12.360><c> together</c><00:06:12.570><c> and</c>

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
realize that we can do this together and
 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.220 align:start position:0%
realize that we can do this together and
that<00:06:13.020><c> there</c><00:06:13.440><c> is</c><00:06:13.560><c> no</c><00:06:13.740><c> us</c><00:06:14.190><c> and</c><00:06:14.250><c> them</c><00:06:15.170><c> thank</c><00:06:16.170><c> you</c>

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 align:start position:0%
that there is no us and them thank you
 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
that there is no us and them thank you
very<00:06:16.410><c> much</c>

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 align:start position:0%

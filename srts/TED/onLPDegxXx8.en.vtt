off slowly you take a long time but each

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
those is the right approach the nurses
 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.990 align:start position:0%
those is the right approach the nurses
in<00:01:07.479><c> my</c><00:01:07.770><c> department</c><00:01:08.770><c> thought</c><00:01:09.610><c> that</c><00:01:09.759><c> the</c><00:01:09.850><c> right</c>

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
in my department thought that the right
 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
in my department thought that the right
approach<00:01:10.180><c> was</c><00:01:10.570><c> the</c><00:01:10.600><c> ripping</c><00:01:11.080><c> wound</c><00:01:11.259><c> so</c><00:01:11.830><c> they</c>

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 align:start position:0%
approach was the ripping wound so they
 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.590 align:start position:0%
approach was the ripping wound so they
would<00:01:12.100><c> grab</c><00:01:12.400><c> hold</c><00:01:12.670><c> and</c><00:01:12.970><c> they</c><00:01:13.030><c> would</c><00:01:13.180><c> rip</c><00:01:13.390><c> and</c>

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
would grab hold and they would rip and
 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
would grab hold and they would rip and
they<00:01:13.659><c> would</c><00:01:13.780><c> grab</c><00:01:14.020><c> hold</c><00:01:14.320><c> then</c><00:01:14.470><c> they</c><00:01:14.530><c> would</c><00:01:14.680><c> rip</c>

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 align:start position:0%
they would grab hold then they would rip
 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
they would grab hold then they would rip
because<00:01:15.789><c> I</c><00:01:15.820><c> had</c><00:01:16.030><c> 70%</c><00:01:16.420><c> of</c><00:01:16.749><c> my</c><00:01:16.929><c> body</c><00:01:16.960><c> burned</c><00:01:17.499><c> it</c>

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 align:start position:0%

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.789 align:start position:0%
because I had 70% of my body burned it
would<00:01:17.770><c> take</c><00:01:17.920><c> about</c><00:01:18.039><c> an</c><00:01:18.280><c> hour</c><00:01:18.399><c> and</c><00:01:19.350><c> as</c><00:01:20.350><c> you</c><00:01:20.560><c> can</c>

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
would take about an hour and as you can
 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.209 align:start position:0%
would take about an hour and as you can

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 align:start position:0%
imagine I hated that moment of ripping
 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.639 align:start position:0%

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 align:start position:0%
with incredible intensity and I would
 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.200 align:start position:0%

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 align:start position:0%
try to reason with them and say why
 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.910 align:start position:0%

don't we try something else why don't we
 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.919 align:start position:0%
don't we try something else why don't we

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 align:start position:0%
take it a little longer maybe two hours

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
so my interest in cheating started when
Enron<00:04:34.330><c> came</c><00:04:35.050><c> on</c><00:04:35.169><c> the</c><00:04:35.260><c> scene</c><00:04:35.470><c> exploded</c><00:04:36.039><c> all</c><00:04:36.159><c> of</c>

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 align:start position:0%
Enron came on the scene exploded all of
 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.690 align:start position:0%
Enron came on the scene exploded all of
a<00:04:36.340><c> sudden</c>

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 align:start position:0%
a sudden
 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
a sudden
and<00:04:37.120><c> I</c><00:04:37.210><c> started</c><00:04:37.570><c> thinking</c><00:04:37.990><c> about</c><00:04:38.080><c> what</c><00:04:38.410><c> is</c>

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
and I started thinking about what is
 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
and I started thinking about what is
happening<00:04:39.070><c> here</c><00:04:39.310><c> is</c><00:04:39.460><c> it</c><00:04:39.580><c> the</c><00:04:39.670><c> case</c><00:04:39.910><c> that</c><00:04:39.940><c> auras</c>

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 align:start position:0%
happening here is it the case that auras
 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
happening here is it the case that auras
got<00:04:40.450><c> a</c><00:04:40.480><c> few</c><00:04:40.870><c> apples</c><00:04:41.260><c> who</c><00:04:41.590><c> are</c><00:04:41.710><c> capable</c><00:04:42.670><c> of</c>

got a few apples who are capable of
 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.190 align:start position:0%
got a few apples who are capable of

doing these things or are we talking
 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.350 align:start position:0%
doing these things or are we talking

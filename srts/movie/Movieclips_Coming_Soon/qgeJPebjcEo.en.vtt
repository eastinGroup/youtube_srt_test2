sort of at the you know end of his days
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.470 align:start position:0%
sort of at the you know end of his days
yeah<00:00:34.829><c> it</c><00:00:35.820><c> wouldn't</c><00:00:36.000><c> have</c><00:00:36.120><c> been</c><00:00:36.239><c> as</c><00:00:36.329><c> powerful</c>

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it wouldn't have been as powerful
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.369 align:start position:0%
yeah it wouldn't have been as powerful
the<00:00:36.840><c> thing</c><00:00:37.110><c> that</c><00:00:37.320><c> made</c><00:00:37.680><c> it</c><00:00:37.710><c> potentially</c>

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 align:start position:0%
the thing that made it potentially
 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.389 align:start position:0%
the thing that made it potentially
meaningful<00:00:40.460><c> wasn't</c><00:00:41.570><c> just</c><00:00:42.770><c> who</c><00:00:43.770><c> does</c><00:00:44.010><c> it</c><00:00:44.280><c> and</c>

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
meaningful wasn't just who does it and
 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
meaningful wasn't just who does it and
how<00:00:44.670><c> it</c><00:00:44.879><c> happened</c><00:00:45.950><c> but</c><00:00:46.950><c> it's</c><00:00:47.100><c> that</c><00:00:47.340><c> that</c><00:00:48.270><c> he</c><00:00:48.510><c> is</c>

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 align:start position:0%
how it happened but it's that that he is
 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.470 align:start position:0%
how it happened but it's that that he is
that<00:00:49.890><c> it</c><00:00:50.250><c> is</c><00:00:50.370><c> a</c><00:00:50.399><c> character</c><00:00:50.789><c> that's</c><00:00:50.879><c> so</c><00:00:51.000><c> vital</c>

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
that it is a character that's so vital
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.580 align:start position:0%
that it is a character that's so vital
mm-hmm<00:00:51.930><c> that</c><00:00:52.530><c> is</c><00:00:52.649><c> going</c><00:00:53.449><c> meaning</c><00:00:54.449><c> his</c><00:00:54.590><c> demise</c>

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 align:start position:0%
wanted to do and that's why he argued
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to do and that's why he argued
back<00:01:07.680><c> in</c><00:01:07.860><c> the</c><00:01:07.950><c> day</c><00:01:08.100><c> yeah</c><00:01:08.430><c> that</c><00:01:08.939><c> Han</c><00:01:09.150><c> should</c><00:01:09.420><c> die</c>

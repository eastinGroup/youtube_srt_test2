yeah I don't know how practical it is
 

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.969 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know how practical it is
because<00:08:37.149><c> it</c><00:08:37.329><c> looks</c><00:08:37.510><c> like</c><00:08:37.719><c> if</c><00:08:37.990><c> you</c><00:08:38.199><c> know</c><00:08:38.380><c> if</c><00:08:38.680><c> the</c>

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:38.979 align:start position:0%
because it looks like if you know if the
 

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:41.130 align:start position:0%
because it looks like if you know if the

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.140 align:start position:0%
the beam would were to slide down it
 

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
the beam would were to slide down it
would<00:08:41.320><c> end</c><00:08:41.560><c> up</c><00:08:41.800><c> cutting</c><00:08:42.099><c> all</c><00:08:42.310><c> that</c><00:08:42.339><c> it</c><00:08:42.729><c> looks</c>

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:42.909 align:start position:0%
would end up cutting all that it looks
 

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.519 align:start position:0%
would end up cutting all that it looks
homemade<00:08:43.269><c> to</c><00:08:43.659><c> that's</c><00:08:43.930><c> the</c><00:08:44.050><c> other</c><00:08:44.140><c> thing</c><00:08:44.260><c> it</c>

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:44.529 align:start position:0%
homemade to that's the other thing it
 

00:08:44.529 --> 00:08:45.870 align:start position:0%
homemade to that's the other thing it
looks<00:08:44.709><c> like</c><00:08:44.890><c> he</c><00:08:45.190><c> made</c><00:08:45.399><c> that</c><00:08:45.519><c> what</c><00:08:45.760><c> this</c>

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
looks like he made that what this
 

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.490 align:start position:0%
looks like he made that what this

character made it himself it looks fiery
 

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
character made it himself it looks fiery
it<00:08:47.829><c> doesn't</c><00:08:48.070><c> look</c><00:08:48.160><c> like</c><00:08:48.310><c> an</c><00:08:48.399><c> energy</c><00:08:48.819><c> beam</c><00:08:49.000><c> i</c>

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah a most lightsabers are which I
 

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.050 align:start position:0%
yeah a most lightsabers are which I
don't<00:08:51.100><c> know</c><00:08:51.250><c> if</c><00:08:51.310><c> that's</c><00:08:51.459><c> gonna</c><00:08:51.579><c> be</c><00:08:51.760><c> sort</c><00:08:52.029><c> of</c>

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:52.060 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's gonna be sort of
 

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.430 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's gonna be sort of
like<00:08:52.120><c> the</c><00:08:52.270><c> evolution</c><00:08:52.480><c> of</c><00:08:52.750><c> lightsabers</c>

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
or what I'm thinking is this might be a
 

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.269 align:start position:0%
or what I'm thinking is this might be a

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
thing about this title treatment layer I
honestly<00:11:56.950><c> think</c><00:11:57.160><c> that</c><00:11:57.280><c> this</c><00:11:57.520><c> is</c><00:11:57.700><c> so</c>

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.010 align:start position:0%
honestly think that this is so

no<00:12:03.520><c> I</c><00:12:03.820><c> will</c><00:12:03.940><c> be</c><00:12:04.030><c> the</c><00:12:04.060><c> one</c><00:12:04.240><c> to</c><00:12:04.360><c> say</c><00:12:04.510><c> it</c><00:12:04.630><c> but</c><00:12:04.990><c> why</c>

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:05.140 align:start position:0%
no I will be the one to say it but why
 

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.190 align:start position:0%
no I will be the one to say it but why
because<00:12:05.800><c> because</c><00:12:06.450><c> just</c><00:12:07.450><c> a</c><00:12:07.570><c> very</c><00:12:08.020><c> simple</c>

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
movement no but it's not even about that
it's<00:12:10.690><c> about</c><00:12:10.840><c> the</c><00:12:11.170><c> fact</c><00:12:11.350><c> that</c><00:12:11.500><c> the</c><00:12:12.370><c> letters</c><00:12:12.760><c> are</c>

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:12.790 align:start position:0%
it's about the fact that the letters are

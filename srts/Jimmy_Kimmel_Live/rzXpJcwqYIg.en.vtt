simulation a two-year-old jumps on a
coffee<00:08:01.440><c> table</c><00:08:01.759><c> and</c><00:08:01.840><c> someone</c><00:08:02.160><c> says</c>

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
coffee table and someone says
 

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.150 align:start position:0%
coffee table and someone says
that's<00:08:04.400><c> a</c><00:08:04.479><c> coffee</c><00:08:04.879><c> table</c><00:08:05.199><c> don't</c><00:08:05.440><c> jump</c><00:08:05.680><c> on</c><00:08:05.759><c> that</c>

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's a coffee table don't jump on that
 

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.510 align:start position:0%
that's a coffee table don't jump on that
so<00:08:06.319><c> it</c><00:08:06.400><c> went</c><00:08:06.639><c> from</c><00:08:06.800><c> being</c><00:08:07.039><c> something</c><00:08:07.360><c> that</c>

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
so it went from being something that
 

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.710 align:start position:0%
so it went from being something that
makes<00:08:07.759><c> him</c><00:08:07.919><c> feel</c><00:08:08.240><c> like</c>

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%

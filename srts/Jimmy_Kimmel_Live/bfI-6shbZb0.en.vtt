00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a reason he was nervous
 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.860 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a reason he was nervous
because<00:05:58.070><c> Archie's</c><00:05:58.580><c> only</c><00:05:58.880><c> smoked</c><00:05:59.180><c> cigars</c><00:05:59.390><c> I</c>

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 align:start position:0%
because Archie's only smoked cigars I
 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
because Archie's only smoked cigars I
think<00:06:00.080><c> it's</c><00:06:00.200><c> one</c><00:06:00.350><c> of</c><00:06:00.470><c> the</c><00:06:00.530><c> problems</c><00:06:02.410><c> what</c>

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 align:start position:0%
think it's one of the problems what
 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.350 align:start position:0%
think it's one of the problems what
about<00:06:03.680><c> when</c><00:06:03.950><c> you're</c><00:06:04.100><c> doing</c><00:06:04.490><c> a</c><00:06:04.640><c> play</c><00:06:04.850><c> like</c><00:06:05.330><c> that</c>

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
about when you're doing a play like that
 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
about when you're doing a play like that
and<00:06:05.930><c> somebody</c><00:06:06.680><c> loses</c><00:06:06.890><c> their</c><00:06:07.340><c> place</c><00:06:07.790><c> or</c><00:06:08.060><c> screws</c>

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 align:start position:0%
the most of it he maybe it was the
 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
the most of it he maybe it was the
perfect<00:06:12.380><c> person</c><00:06:12.650><c> to</c><00:06:12.920><c> screw</c><00:06:13.100><c> it</c><00:06:13.280><c> away</c><00:06:13.550><c> it</c><00:06:13.730><c> was</c>

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 align:start position:0%
perfect person to screw it away it was
 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.030 align:start position:0%
perfect person to screw it away it was
better<00:06:14.120><c> when</c><00:06:14.360><c> he</c><00:06:14.600><c> got</c><00:06:14.930><c> slow</c><00:06:15.440><c> then</c><00:06:15.680><c> we</c><00:06:15.830><c> are</c><00:06:16.010><c> I</c>

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
better when he got slow then we are I
 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.350 align:start position:0%

have<00:01:27.390><c> a</c><00:01:27.420><c> show</c><00:01:28.220><c> that's</c><00:01:29.220><c> as</c><00:01:29.369><c> long</c><00:01:29.700><c> as</c><00:01:30.000><c> it</c><00:01:30.119><c> is</c>

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 align:start position:0%
have a show that's as long as it is
 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.499 align:start position:0%
have a show that's as long as it is
things<00:01:31.530><c> are</c><00:01:31.650><c> gonna</c><00:01:31.770><c> happen</c><00:01:32.009><c> and</c><00:01:32.430><c> I</c><00:01:32.640><c> think</c><00:01:32.909><c> the</c>

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 align:start position:0%
things are gonna happen and I think the
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 align:start position:0%
things are gonna happen and I think the
problem<00:01:33.930><c> with</c><00:01:34.020><c> the</c><00:01:34.200><c> no</c><00:01:34.439><c> host</c><00:01:34.770><c> thing</c><00:01:35.040><c> perhaps</c>

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 align:start position:0%
problem with the no host thing perhaps
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.580 align:start position:0%
problem with the no host thing perhaps
is<00:01:35.970><c> that</c><00:01:36.540><c> there's</c><00:01:36.720><c> not</c><00:01:36.840><c> somebody</c><00:01:37.200><c> out</c><00:01:37.259><c> there</c>

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 align:start position:0%
is that there's not somebody out there

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
two must be false
 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.830 align:start position:0%
two must be false
it's<00:01:57.840><c> not</c><00:01:58.079><c> so</c><00:01:58.399><c> because</c><00:01:58.880><c> the</c><00:01:59.040><c> second</c><00:01:59.360><c> statement</c>

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's not so because the second statement
 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.350 align:start position:0%
it's not so because the second statement
turns<00:02:00.079><c> out</c><00:02:00.240><c> to</c><00:02:00.320><c> be</c><00:02:00.479><c> correct</c>

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
turns out to be correct
 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.069 align:start position:0%
turns out to be correct
so<00:02:01.759><c> this</c><00:02:02.000><c> assumption's</c><00:02:02.560><c> wrong</c><00:02:03.439><c> if</c><00:02:03.600><c> the</c><00:02:03.759><c> second</c>

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
so this assumption's wrong if the second
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.190 align:start position:0%
so this assumption's wrong if the second

the crown isn't in the first chest it's

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
then it must be in the third one but

then it must be in the third one but

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
this makes the third statement correct
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.309 align:start position:0%

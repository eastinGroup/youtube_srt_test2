but<00:00:32.340><c> first</c><00:00:32.610><c> let's</c><00:00:32.969><c> figure</c><00:00:33.210><c> out</c><00:00:33.329><c> what</c><00:00:33.630><c> gravity</c>

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
but first let's figure out what gravity
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.979 align:start position:0%
but first let's figure out what gravity
is<00:00:34.290><c> simply</c><00:00:35.190><c> it's</c><00:00:35.489><c> a</c><00:00:35.610><c> force</c><00:00:35.940><c> that</c><00:00:36.030><c> draws</c><00:00:36.420><c> atoms</c>

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 align:start position:0%
is simply it's a force that draws atoms
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.709 align:start position:0%
is simply it's a force that draws atoms

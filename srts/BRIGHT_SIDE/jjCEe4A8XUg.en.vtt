00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
number of bytes in a week is 7x and the
 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
number of bytes in a week is 7x and the

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 align:start position:0%
number of bytes every patient has is 2x
 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.389 align:start position:0%
number of bytes every patient has is 2x
so<00:02:07.340><c> the</c><00:02:07.729><c> doctor</c><00:02:08.119><c> got</c><00:02:08.270><c> 7</c><00:02:08.780><c> X</c><00:02:08.959><c> minus</c><00:02:09.649><c> 2</c><00:02:09.890><c> X</c><00:02:09.920><c> bytes</c>

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
so the doctor got 7 X minus 2 X bytes
 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.850 align:start position:0%
so the doctor got 7 X minus 2 X bytes
and<00:02:10.640><c> we</c><00:02:11.360><c> know</c><00:02:11.510><c> that</c><00:02:11.780><c> the</c><00:02:11.870><c> number</c><00:02:12.260><c> should</c><00:02:12.470><c> equal</c>

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 align:start position:0%
and we know that the number should equal
 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.100 align:start position:0%
and we know that the number should equal
100<00:02:13.520><c> so</c><00:02:14.180><c> 7x</c><00:02:14.959><c> minus</c><00:02:15.590><c> 2x</c><00:02:15.980><c> equals</c><00:02:16.250><c> 100</c><00:02:17.180><c> therefore</c>

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 align:start position:0%
100 so 7x minus 2x equals 100 therefore
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:27.400 align:start position:0%

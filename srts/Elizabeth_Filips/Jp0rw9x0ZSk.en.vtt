to want to do more things which i guess
 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.590 align:start position:0%
to want to do more things which i guess
is<00:05:06.800><c> okay</c>

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
is okay
 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.909 align:start position:0%

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
you're not even going to remember that
 

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.070 align:start position:0%
you're not even going to remember that
and<00:09:02.480><c> it's</c><00:09:02.640><c> really</c><00:09:02.959><c> not</c><00:09:03.120><c> going</c><00:09:03.279><c> to</c><00:09:03.360><c> matter</c>

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it's really not going to matter
 

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.870 align:start position:0%
and it's really not going to matter
so<00:09:04.560><c> i</c><00:09:04.800><c> think</c><00:09:05.120><c> that</c><00:09:05.760><c> my</c><00:09:06.000><c> advice</c><00:09:06.320><c> would</c><00:09:06.399><c> be</c><00:09:06.640><c> to</c>

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that my advice would be to
 

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
so i think that my advice would be to
look<00:09:07.120><c> at</c><00:09:07.200><c> these</c><00:09:07.440><c> older</c><00:09:07.680><c> doctors</c>

look at these older doctors
 

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.790 align:start position:0%
look at these older doctors

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
and to realize how little they care
 

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.630 align:start position:0%
and to realize how little they care
right<00:09:11.040><c> now</c><00:09:11.519><c> about</c><00:09:11.760><c> their</c><00:09:11.920><c> medical</c><00:09:12.320><c> school</c>

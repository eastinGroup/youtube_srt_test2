00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.830 align:start position:0%
think of ourselves five years ago
it's<00:02:30.080><c> very</c><00:02:30.319><c> very</c><00:02:30.640><c> likely</c><00:02:31.040><c> that</c><00:02:31.200><c> those</c><00:02:31.599><c> two</c>

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's very very likely that those two
 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
it's very very likely that those two
people<00:02:32.239><c> are</c><00:02:32.560><c> extremely</c>

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
people are extremely
 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.390 align:start position:0%
people are extremely
different<00:02:34.480><c> and</c><00:02:35.200><c> this</c><00:02:35.440><c> has</c><00:02:35.599><c> definitely</c><00:02:36.160><c> been</c>

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
different and this has definitely been
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.589 align:start position:0%
different and this has definitely been
the<00:02:36.560><c> case</c><00:02:36.879><c> for</c><00:02:37.040><c> me</c>

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
the case for me
 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.350 align:start position:0%
the case for me
in<00:02:37.760><c> my</c><00:02:37.920><c> second</c><00:02:38.160><c> year</c><00:02:38.319><c> of</c><00:02:38.400><c> medical</c><00:02:38.720><c> school</c><00:02:39.120><c> i</c>

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
in my second year of medical school i
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.270 align:start position:0%
in my second year of medical school i
found<00:02:39.760><c> that</c><00:02:40.319><c> all</c><00:02:40.480><c> the</c><00:02:40.560><c> reasons</c>

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
found that all the reasons
 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.270 align:start position:0%
found that all the reasons
for<00:02:41.440><c> which</c><00:02:41.760><c> i've</c><00:02:41.920><c> wanted</c><00:02:42.239><c> to</c><00:02:42.319><c> do</c><00:02:42.480><c> medicine</c>

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
for which i've wanted to do medicine
 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.190 align:start position:0%
for which i've wanted to do medicine
have<00:02:44.080><c> disappeared</c>

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
have disappeared
 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.070 align:start position:0%
have disappeared
or<00:02:46.080><c> changed</c><00:02:46.640><c> or</c><00:02:46.959><c> i</c><00:02:47.120><c> fully</c><00:02:47.440><c> disagree</c><00:02:47.760><c> with</c><00:02:47.920><c> them</c>

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
or changed or i fully disagree with them
 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.990 align:start position:0%
or changed or i fully disagree with them
so<00:02:48.239><c> i</c><00:02:48.400><c> think</c><00:02:48.560><c> that</c><00:02:48.800><c> if</c><00:02:48.879><c> you</c><00:02:49.040><c> do</c><00:02:49.280><c> anything</c><00:02:49.760><c> over</c>

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that if you do anything over
 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.750 align:start position:0%
so i think that if you do anything over
five<00:02:50.319><c> years</c><00:02:50.640><c> or</c><00:02:50.800><c> even</c><00:02:50.959><c> if</c><00:02:51.120><c> you</c><00:02:51.200><c> do</c><00:02:51.360><c> nothing</c>

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
five years or even if you do nothing
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.710 align:start position:0%
five years or even if you do nothing
over<00:02:52.000><c> five</c><00:02:52.239><c> years</c>

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
over five years
 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.030 align:start position:0%
over five years
you<00:02:52.959><c> will</c><00:02:53.200><c> definitely</c><00:02:53.840><c> change</c><00:02:54.239><c> a</c><00:02:54.319><c> lot</c><00:02:54.720><c> and</c><00:02:54.879><c> you</c>

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
you will definitely change a lot and you
 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.990 align:start position:0%
you will definitely change a lot and you
might<00:02:55.440><c> find</c>

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
might find
 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.830 align:start position:0%
might find
that<00:02:56.160><c> the</c><00:02:56.319><c> person</c><00:02:56.560><c> that</c><00:02:56.720><c> you</c><00:02:56.879><c> become</c><00:02:57.519><c> does</c><00:02:57.680><c> not</c>

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
that the person that you become does not
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.990 align:start position:0%
that the person that you become does not

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
feel the same way about your university
 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.830 align:start position:0%

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
or about your workload or about what
 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.110 align:start position:0%
or about your workload or about what
they<00:03:02.000><c> want</c><00:03:02.159><c> to</c><00:03:02.239><c> do</c><00:03:02.400><c> for</c><00:03:02.560><c> the</c><00:03:02.640><c> rest</c><00:03:02.879><c> of</c><00:03:02.959><c> their</c>

they want to do for the rest of their
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.670 align:start position:0%
they want to do for the rest of their

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
lives
 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.509 align:start position:0%
lives
so<00:03:04.239><c> this</c><00:03:04.400><c> was</c><00:03:04.560><c> something</c><00:03:04.879><c> that</c><00:03:05.040><c> i</c><00:03:05.200><c> really</c>

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 align:start position:0%
so this was something that i really
 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.190 align:start position:0%
so this was something that i really
hadn't<00:03:05.840><c> considered</c><00:03:06.319><c> i</c><00:03:06.480><c> started</c><00:03:06.800><c> medicine</c>

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
hadn't considered i started medicine
 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.949 align:start position:0%
hadn't considered i started medicine
thinking<00:03:07.599><c> i</c><00:03:07.760><c> would</c><00:03:08.000><c> always</c><00:03:08.319><c> have</c><00:03:08.480><c> the</c><00:03:08.640><c> same</c>

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
needs and that definitely changed so
 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.710 align:start position:0%
needs and that definitely changed so
i<00:03:14.879><c> think</c><00:03:15.040><c> having</c><00:03:15.360><c> a</c><00:03:15.440><c> bit</c><00:03:15.840><c> more</c><00:03:16.080><c> of</c><00:03:16.239><c> an</c><00:03:16.400><c> open</c>

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%

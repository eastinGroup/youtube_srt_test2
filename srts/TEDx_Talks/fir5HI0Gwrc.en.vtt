00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:42.690 align:start position:0%
the leg reach down and felt it and
 

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.660 align:start position:0%
the leg reach down and felt it and
thought<00:10:43.319><c> about</c><00:10:43.350><c> it</c><00:10:43.560><c> for</c><00:10:43.740><c> a</c><00:10:43.800><c> while</c><00:10:43.920><c> and</c><00:10:44.190><c> he</c>

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:44.670 align:start position:0%
thought about it for a while and he
 

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.699 align:start position:0%
thought about it for a while and he
turned<00:10:44.880><c> to</c><00:10:44.970><c> us</c><00:10:45.029><c> and</c><00:10:45.180><c> he</c><00:10:45.240><c> said</c><00:10:45.500><c> that's</c><00:10:46.500><c> the</c>

00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:46.709 align:start position:0%
turned to us and he said that's the
 

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:48.500 align:start position:0%
turned to us and he said that's the
first<00:10:46.920><c> time</c><00:10:47.100><c> I</c><00:10:47.130><c> felt</c><00:10:47.459><c> that</c><00:10:47.519><c> shape</c><00:10:47.910><c> in</c><00:10:48.209><c> eight</c>

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:48.510 align:start position:0%
first time I felt that shape in eight
 

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
first time I felt that shape in eight
years<00:10:48.540><c> and</c><00:10:49.760><c> so</c><00:10:50.760><c> we</c><00:10:50.940><c> thought</c><00:10:51.149><c> about</c><00:10:51.209><c> that</c><00:10:51.510><c> and</c>

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:51.690 align:start position:0%
years and so we thought about that and
 

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.970 align:start position:0%
years and so we thought about that and
for<00:10:51.750><c> all</c><00:10:51.899><c> the</c><00:10:52.079><c> technology</c><00:10:52.380><c> and</c><00:10:52.769><c> all</c><00:10:52.949><c> the</c>

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
for all the technology and all the

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
nights and energy we put into it like
 

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.550 align:start position:0%
nights and energy we put into it like
that's<00:10:55.980><c> really</c><00:10:56.160><c> all</c><00:10:56.399><c> we</c><00:10:56.519><c> wanted</c><00:10:56.790><c> to</c><00:10:56.850><c> hear</c>

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%

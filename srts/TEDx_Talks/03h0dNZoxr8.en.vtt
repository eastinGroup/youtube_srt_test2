brain cells will die and never come back

brain cells will die and never come back
so<00:01:07.619><c> you</c><00:01:08.280><c> could</c><00:01:08.549><c> argue</c><00:01:08.850><c> that</c><00:01:08.880><c> the</c><00:01:09.150><c> dying</c>

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
so you could argue that the dying
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.219 align:start position:0%
so you could argue that the dying

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 align:start position:0%
gonna go on for something like two
 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.389 align:start position:0%
gonna go on for something like two

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 align:start position:0%

ten<00:02:02.549><c> years</c><00:02:02.759><c> later</c><00:02:02.909><c> so</c><00:02:03.299><c> it</c><00:02:03.689><c> was</c><00:02:03.810><c> something</c><00:02:03.959><c> that</c>

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 align:start position:0%
ten years later so it was something that

we can bring to this situation and I
walked<00:09:40.860><c> and</c><00:09:40.980><c> we</c><00:09:41.130><c> wanted</c><00:09:41.400><c> to</c><00:09:41.490><c> really</c><00:09:41.640><c> pull</c>

together a very specific response that
 

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:45.860 align:start position:0%
together a very specific response that

was about the strength of our community
 

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.090 align:start position:0%
was about the strength of our community
and<00:09:46.050><c> so</c><00:09:47.040><c> we</c><00:09:47.580><c> decided</c><00:09:48.480><c> to</c><00:09:48.839><c> you</c><00:09:49.650><c> know</c><00:09:49.740><c> take</c><00:09:49.950><c> this</c>

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
and so we decided to you know take this
 

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
and so we decided to you know take this

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.050 align:start position:0%
idea and to to see if there was a place
 

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
idea and to to see if there was a place
in<00:09:52.080><c> Haiti</c><00:09:52.380><c> that</c><00:09:52.560><c> this</c><00:09:52.710><c> would</c><00:09:52.860><c> make</c><00:09:53.010><c> sense</c><00:09:53.280><c> and</c>

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:53.490 align:start position:0%
in Haiti that this would make sense and
 

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.050 align:start position:0%
in Haiti that this would make sense and

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.060 align:start position:0%

would be great
 

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.370 align:start position:0%

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
so we had her help us serve lunch and
 

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
so we had her help us serve lunch and
then<00:10:49.500><c> she</c><00:10:49.620><c> had</c><00:10:49.740><c> her</c><00:10:49.770><c> baby</c><00:10:49.980><c> in</c><00:10:50.160><c> the</c><00:10:50.220><c> middle</c><00:10:50.460><c> of</c>

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:50.730 align:start position:0%
then she had her baby in the middle of
 

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.230 align:start position:0%
then she had her baby in the middle of
the<00:10:51.180><c> project</c><00:10:52.050><c> and</c><00:10:52.260><c> so</c><00:10:52.440><c> now</c><00:10:52.650><c> my</c><00:10:52.950><c> hope</c><00:10:53.730><c> is</c><00:10:53.940><c> that</c>

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%

this guy
it<00:01:51.120><c> hurts</c><00:01:51.450><c> and</c><00:01:52.520><c> finally</c><00:01:53.520><c> the</c><00:01:53.700><c> most</c><00:01:53.850><c> epic</c><00:01:54.060><c> fail</c>

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 align:start position:0%
it hurts and finally the most epic fail
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.260 align:start position:0%
it hurts and finally the most epic fail
of<00:01:54.420><c> all</c><00:01:54.800><c> and</c><00:01:55.800><c> so</c><00:01:56.550><c> I</c><00:01:56.580><c> thought</c><00:01:56.850><c> about</c><00:01:57.030><c> what</c><00:01:57.180><c> this</c>

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 align:start position:0%
of all and so I thought about what this
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.690 align:start position:0%
of all and so I thought about what this
would<00:01:57.420><c> mean</c><00:01:57.480><c> to</c><00:01:57.990><c> society</c><00:01:58.530><c> in</c><00:01:58.920><c> all</c><00:01:59.250><c> honesty</c>

but you're taught to believe that

they're actually the same length it's an

they're actually the same length it's an

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%

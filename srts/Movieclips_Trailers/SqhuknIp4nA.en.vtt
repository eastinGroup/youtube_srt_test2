00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
and when it was kind of playing I think
 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.850 align:start position:0%
and when it was kind of playing I think
it<00:02:42.000><c> played</c><00:02:42.150><c> at</c><00:02:42.240><c> Sundance</c><00:02:42.600><c> it</c><00:02:43.290><c> had</c><00:02:43.440><c> so</c><00:02:43.740><c> much</c>

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
it played at Sundance it had so much
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.460 align:start position:0%

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 align:start position:0%

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.110 align:start position:0%
hype around it right and this for such a
low<00:02:46.709><c> budget</c><00:02:46.920><c> I</c><00:02:47.100><c> think</c><00:02:47.130><c> it</c><00:02:47.340><c> was</c><00:02:47.430><c> like</c><00:02:47.520><c> one</c><00:02:47.760><c> three</c>

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
low budget I think it was like one three
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.270 align:start position:0%
low budget I think it was like one three
or<00:02:48.150><c> so</c><00:02:48.450><c> is</c><00:02:48.569><c> really</c><00:02:48.600><c> cheap</c><00:02:49.350><c> I'm</c><00:02:49.560><c> making</c><00:02:50.130><c> like</c><00:02:50.250><c> a</c>

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
or so is really cheap I'm making like a

speed which is a video game series
that's<00:00:34.440><c> been</c><00:00:34.559><c> going</c><00:00:34.620><c> on</c><00:00:34.770><c> for</c><00:00:34.950><c> almost</c><00:00:34.980><c> 20</c><00:00:35.520><c> years</c>

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for almost 20 years
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for almost 20 years
now<00:00:35.850><c> yeah</c><00:00:36.480><c> and</c><00:00:36.750><c> so</c><00:00:37.020><c> every</c><00:00:37.800><c> year</c><00:00:37.860><c> we</c><00:00:38.129><c> get</c><00:00:38.370><c> a</c><00:00:38.430><c> new</c>

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 align:start position:0%
now yeah and so every year we get a new
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.250 align:start position:0%
now yeah and so every year we get a new
need<00:00:38.820><c> for</c><00:00:38.850><c> speed</c><00:00:39.059><c> last</c><00:00:39.660><c> year</c><00:00:39.870><c> we</c><00:00:39.960><c> had</c><00:00:39.989><c> most</c>

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
need for speed last year we had most
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 align:start position:0%
need for speed last year we had most
wanted<00:00:40.680><c> which</c><00:00:40.890><c> I</c><00:00:41.010><c> thought</c><00:00:41.190><c> was</c><00:00:41.309><c> an</c><00:00:41.460><c> excellent</c>

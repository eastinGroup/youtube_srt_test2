00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
because I definitely went up to the
 

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.970 align:start position:0%
because I definitely went up to the

maximum like bar a couple of characters
 

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.490 align:start position:0%
maximum like bar a couple of characters
so<00:10:21.340><c> I</c><00:10:21.370><c> think</c><00:10:21.490><c> the</c><00:10:22.240><c> you</c><00:10:22.480><c> cast</c><00:10:22.750><c> character</c><00:10:23.200><c> system</c>

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:23.500 align:start position:0%
so I think the you cast character system
 

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
so I think the you cast character system
is<00:10:23.590><c> slightly</c><00:10:23.890><c> different</c><00:10:24.130><c> to</c><00:10:24.280><c> words</c><00:10:24.580><c> so</c><00:10:24.790><c> if</c>

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:24.910 align:start position:0%
is slightly different to words so if
 

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
is slightly different to words so if
you're<00:10:25.030><c> working</c><00:10:25.210><c> on</c><00:10:25.330><c> your</c><00:10:25.510><c> personal</c>

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
you're working on your personal
 

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
you're working on your personal
statement<00:10:26.080><c> and</c><00:10:26.170><c> you</c><00:10:26.230><c> want</c><00:10:26.350><c> to</c><00:10:26.440><c> check</c><00:10:26.530><c> your</c>

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:26.590 align:start position:0%
statement and you want to check your
 

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.530 align:start position:0%
statement and you want to check your
characters<00:10:27.070><c> there</c><00:10:27.490><c> are</c><00:10:27.520><c> things</c><00:10:27.880><c> online</c><00:10:28.060><c> or</c>

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:28.540 align:start position:0%
characters there are things online or
 

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
characters there are things online or
maybe<00:10:29.440><c> they</c><00:10:29.590><c> link</c><00:10:29.740><c> one</c><00:10:29.860><c> down</c><00:10:30.040><c> below</c><00:10:30.160><c> it's</c><00:10:30.430><c> just</c>

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:30.550 align:start position:0%
maybe they link one down below it's just
 

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
maybe they link one down below it's just
like<00:10:30.670><c> a</c><00:10:30.700><c> you</c><00:10:31.030><c> cast</c><00:10:31.300><c> character</c><00:10:31.690><c> count</c><00:10:31.900><c> site</c><00:10:32.320><c> so</c>

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:32.710 align:start position:0%
like a you cast character count site so
 

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.590 align:start position:0%
like a you cast character count site so
it<00:10:32.890><c> will</c><00:10:33.010><c> count</c><00:10:33.220><c> the</c><00:10:33.400><c> characters</c><00:10:33.760><c> as</c><00:10:33.940><c> you</c><00:10:34.360><c> cast</c>

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
it will count the characters as you cast
 

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
it will count the characters as you cast
does<00:10:35.350><c> when</c><00:10:35.620><c> doing</c><00:10:35.830><c> a</c><00:10:35.890><c> person</c><00:10:36.160><c> statement</c><00:10:36.580><c> so</c>

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:36.730 align:start position:0%
does when doing a person statement so
 

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.550 align:start position:0%

you can check of it all fit because it

you can check of it all fit because it

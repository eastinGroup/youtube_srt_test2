00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 align:start position:0%

on the back so this is one pack they
 

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.430 align:start position:0%
on the back so this is one pack they

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:05.780 align:start position:0%
but I found the making process really
 

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
but I found the making process really
useful<00:09:06.350><c> as</c><00:09:06.950><c> well</c><00:09:07.220><c> and</c><00:09:08.680><c> yeah</c><00:09:09.680><c> I</c><00:09:09.980><c> would</c><00:09:10.420><c> make</c><00:09:11.420><c> the</c>

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.250 align:start position:0%
why don't you do this and I was like oh
 

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
why don't you do this and I was like oh
yeah<00:08:58.000><c> and</c><00:08:58.800><c> oh</c><00:08:59.800><c> yeah</c><00:09:00.460><c> so</c><00:09:01.030><c> I</c><00:09:01.300><c> felt</c><00:09:01.780><c> like</c><00:09:01.930><c> I</c><00:09:02.020><c> hadn't</c>

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
got off to the best start and then I got
 

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.450 align:start position:0%
got off to the best start and then I got

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.050 align:start position:0%
remember much about these it's such a
 

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.180 align:start position:0%
remember much about these it's such a
blur<00:09:08.470><c> but</c><00:09:09.280><c> it</c><00:09:09.640><c> was</c><00:09:09.790><c> like</c><00:09:09.970><c> calculating</c>

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:11.190 align:start position:0%
blur but it was like calculating
 

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.730 align:start position:0%
blur but it was like calculating

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:21.460 align:start position:0%
that way because interviews are supposed
 

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.710 align:start position:0%
that way because interviews are supposed

possibly can after much prompting I
 

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.650 align:start position:0%
possibly can after much prompting I
eventually<00:09:26.890><c> like</c><00:09:27.280><c> reach</c><00:09:27.940><c> the</c><00:09:27.970><c> point</c><00:09:28.390><c> where</c>

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
for instance before you get your bread
 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.629 align:start position:0%
for instance before you get your bread
then<00:06:43.280><c> you'll</c><00:06:43.520><c> get</c><00:06:43.680><c> a</c><00:06:43.840><c> boost</c><00:06:44.160><c> then</c><00:06:44.319><c> you'll</c><00:06:44.479><c> get</c>

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
then you'll get a boost then you'll get
 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.510 align:start position:0%
then you'll get a boost then you'll get

so<00:07:12.240><c> that's</c><00:07:12.560><c> like</c><00:07:12.880><c> limiting</c><00:07:14.000><c> at</c><00:07:14.160><c> least</c><00:07:14.400><c> two</c><00:07:14.560><c> to</c>

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
so that's like limiting at least two to
 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.469 align:start position:0%
so that's like limiting at least two to

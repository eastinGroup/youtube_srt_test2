00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
hard to explain
 

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:49.110 align:start position:0%
hard to explain
so<00:10:45.360><c> it</c><00:10:45.440><c> almost</c><00:10:45.760><c> looks</c><00:10:46.000><c> like</c><00:10:47.360><c> a</c><00:10:47.600><c> savory</c><00:10:48.160><c> pear</c>

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.389 align:start position:0%
so it almost looks like a savory pear
right<00:10:50.720><c> but</c><00:10:51.040><c> yeah</c><00:10:51.279><c> it's</c><00:10:51.440><c> really</c><00:10:51.760><c> dense</c><00:10:52.079><c> and</c>

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
right but yeah it's really dense and
 

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:55.030 align:start position:0%
right but yeah it's really dense and
when<00:10:52.640><c> it's</c><00:10:52.880><c> cooked</c><00:10:53.120><c> down</c><00:10:54.399><c> sometimes</c><00:10:54.880><c> you</c>

when it's cooked down sometimes you
 

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.030 align:start position:0%
when it's cooked down sometimes you

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
confuse it for the potato pieces
 

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.949 align:start position:0%
confuse it for the potato pieces
because<00:10:57.279><c> it</c><00:10:57.360><c> kind</c><00:10:57.519><c> of</c><00:10:57.680><c> has</c><00:10:57.839><c> that</c><00:10:58.000><c> same</c>

00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%

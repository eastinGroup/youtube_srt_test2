and you can see where the actuator oil
 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.469 align:start position:0%
and you can see where the actuator oil

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
seasoning on top
 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.909 align:start position:0%
seasoning on top
and<00:04:25.520><c> then</c><00:04:25.919><c> i'm</c><00:04:26.080><c> going</c><00:04:26.320><c> to</c><00:04:26.479><c> get</c><00:04:26.639><c> this</c><00:04:26.960><c> into</c><00:04:27.680><c> our</c>

and then i'm going to get this into our
oven

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
oven
 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.950 align:start position:0%
oven
so<00:04:29.440><c> it's</c><00:04:29.600><c> at</c><00:04:29.759><c> 190</c><00:04:32.240><c> and</c><00:04:32.479><c> i'll</c><00:04:32.560><c> probably</c><00:04:32.800><c> take</c>

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
so it's at 190 and i'll probably take
 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.070 align:start position:0%
so it's at 190 and i'll probably take
about<00:04:33.120><c> 20</c><00:04:33.360><c> to</c><00:04:33.440><c> 30</c><00:04:33.680><c> minutes</c>

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
about 20 to 30 minutes
 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.150 align:start position:0%
about 20 to 30 minutes

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay so we've popped the chicken into
 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.830 align:start position:0%
okay so we've popped the chicken into
the<00:04:36.320><c> oven</c><00:04:36.639><c> it's</c><00:04:36.720><c> been</c><00:04:36.880><c> cooking</c><00:04:37.199><c> away</c><00:04:37.600><c> and</c><00:04:37.759><c> i</c>

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
the oven it's been cooking away and i
 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.270 align:start position:0%
the oven it's been cooking away and i
can<00:04:38.000><c> see</c><00:04:38.160><c> we've</c><00:04:38.400><c> got</c><00:04:38.560><c> a</c><00:04:38.639><c> new</c><00:04:38.960><c> plate</c><00:04:39.199><c> of</c>

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
vegetables out
 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.870 align:start position:0%
vegetables out
so<00:04:40.720><c> what</c><00:04:40.960><c> are</c><00:04:41.040><c> the</c><00:04:41.120><c> next</c><00:04:41.360><c> steps</c><00:04:41.759><c> yeah</c><00:04:42.000><c> so</c><00:04:42.320><c> we</c>

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
so what are the next steps yeah so we
 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.790 align:start position:0%
so what are the next steps yeah so we
are<00:04:43.199><c> going</c><00:04:43.360><c> to</c><00:04:43.440><c> make</c><00:04:43.600><c> what's</c><00:04:43.840><c> called</c><00:04:44.080><c> achara</c>

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
are going to make what's called achara
 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.270 align:start position:0%
are going to make what's called achara
so<00:04:44.960><c> it's</c><00:04:45.120><c> basically</c><00:04:45.759><c> like</c><00:04:45.919><c> a</c><00:04:46.000><c> filipino</c><00:04:46.560><c> pickle</c>

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
so it's basically like a filipino pickle
 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.909 align:start position:0%
so it's basically like a filipino pickle
uh<00:04:47.680><c> usually</c><00:04:48.080><c> we</c><00:04:48.320><c> use</c><00:04:48.639><c> like</c><00:04:48.800><c> a</c><00:04:48.960><c> green</c><00:04:49.199><c> papaya</c><00:04:49.759><c> so</c>

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh usually we use like a green papaya so
 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.350 align:start position:0%
uh usually we use like a green papaya so
it'd<00:04:50.000><c> be</c><00:04:50.160><c> like</c><00:04:50.240><c> a</c><00:04:50.320><c> shredded</c><00:04:50.800><c> green</c><00:04:50.960><c> papaya</c>

that's pickled in vinegar and sugar
i<00:04:53.120><c> use</c><00:04:53.360><c> like</c><00:04:53.520><c> a</c><00:04:53.600><c> substitute</c><00:04:54.080><c> of</c><00:04:54.160><c> like</c><00:04:54.400><c> mooli</c><00:04:55.040><c> so</c>

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
i use like a substitute of like mooli so
 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.070 align:start position:0%
i use like a substitute of like mooli so
i<00:04:55.280><c> use</c><00:04:55.520><c> mooli</c>

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%

the Cold War for physicists in Hungary
and<00:01:57.979><c> I</c><00:01:58.340><c> said</c><00:01:58.640><c> so</c><00:01:58.790><c> what</c><00:01:58.909><c> were</c><00:01:59.060><c> you</c><00:01:59.210><c> doing</c><00:01:59.240><c> and</c><00:01:59.570><c> he</c>

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 align:start position:0%
and I said so what were you doing and he
 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.660 align:start position:0%
and I said so what were you doing and he
said<00:01:59.810><c> well</c><00:01:59.930><c> we</c><00:02:00.049><c> were</c><00:02:00.200><c> mostly</c><00:02:01.159><c> breaking</c>

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 align:start position:0%
said well we were mostly breaking
 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.910 align:start position:0%
said well we were mostly breaking
stealth<00:02:02.060><c> and</c><00:02:02.600><c> I</c><00:02:02.720><c> said</c><00:02:02.930><c> that's</c><00:02:03.140><c> a</c><00:02:03.229><c> good</c><00:02:03.470><c> job</c>

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
stealth and I said that's a good job
 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
stealth and I said that's a good job
that's<00:02:04.880><c> interesting</c><00:02:05.650><c> how</c><00:02:06.650><c> does</c><00:02:06.830><c> that</c><00:02:06.979><c> work</c>

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's interesting how does that work
 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.770 align:start position:0%
that's interesting how does that work
and<00:02:07.610><c> so</c><00:02:07.759><c> to</c><00:02:07.820><c> understand</c><00:02:08.360><c> that</c><00:02:08.509><c> you</c><00:02:08.629><c> have</c><00:02:08.659><c> to</c>

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 align:start position:0%
and so to understand that you have to
 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.570 align:start position:0%
and so to understand that you have to
understand<00:02:09.110><c> a</c><00:02:09.170><c> little</c><00:02:09.200><c> bit</c><00:02:09.470><c> about</c><00:02:10.399><c> how</c>

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit about how
 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.110 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit about how
stealth<00:02:10.879><c> works</c><00:02:11.209><c> and</c><00:02:11.450><c> so</c><00:02:11.629><c> this</c><00:02:12.470><c> is</c><00:02:12.650><c> a</c>

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
stealth works and so this is a
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.580 align:start position:0%
stealth works and so this is a
oversimplification<00:02:14.120><c> but</c><00:02:14.269><c> basically</c><00:02:14.659><c> it's</c>

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 align:start position:0%
oversimplification but basically it's
 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.979 align:start position:0%
oversimplification but basically it's
not<00:02:15.830><c> like</c><00:02:16.040><c> you</c><00:02:16.159><c> can</c><00:02:16.370><c> just</c><00:02:16.400><c> pass</c><00:02:17.390><c> a</c><00:02:17.450><c> radar</c>

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 align:start position:0%
not like you can just pass a radar
 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.550 align:start position:0%
not like you can just pass a radar
signal<00:02:18.170><c> right</c><00:02:18.500><c> through</c><00:02:19.629><c> 156</c><00:02:20.629><c> tons</c><00:02:21.019><c> of</c><00:02:21.230><c> steel</c>

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 align:start position:0%
in the sky it's not just going to
 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.490 align:start position:0%
in the sky it's not just going to
disappear

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 align:start position:0%
disappear
 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.160 align:start position:0%

but<00:02:24.980><c> if</c><00:02:25.070><c> you</c><00:02:25.160><c> can</c><00:02:25.340><c> take</c><00:02:25.700><c> this</c><00:02:26.090><c> big</c><00:02:26.480><c> massive</c>

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 align:start position:0%
but if you can take this big massive
 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.690 align:start position:0%
but if you can take this big massive
thing<00:02:27.530><c> and</c><00:02:27.830><c> you</c><00:02:28.490><c> could</c><00:02:28.730><c> turn</c><00:02:29.690><c> it</c><00:02:29.870><c> into</c><00:02:29.990><c> a</c>

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 align:start position:0%

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
bad job and he said yeah he said but

bad job and he said yeah he said but
that's<00:02:46.790><c> if</c><00:02:47.000><c> you're</c><00:02:47.180><c> a</c><00:02:47.210><c> radar</c><00:02:47.750><c> he</c><00:02:48.140><c> said</c><00:02:48.320><c> so</c><00:02:48.440><c> we</c>

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 align:start position:0%
that's if you're a radar he said so we
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.890 align:start position:0%
that's if you're a radar he said so we

something to do with the Americans and I
 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.590 align:start position:0%
something to do with the Americans and I

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
said yeah that's that's good that's good
 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.290 align:start position:0%
said yeah that's that's good that's good
so<00:03:05.810><c> you've</c><00:03:06.020><c> effectively</c><00:03:06.950><c> negated</c><00:03:07.610><c> 60</c><00:03:08.060><c> years</c>

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 align:start position:0%
so you've effectively negated 60 years

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.110 align:start position:0%
and the idea that architecture itself is

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
consider by my lecturer so then I just
 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.870 align:start position:0%
consider by my lecturer so then I just
decided<00:01:48.289><c> to</c><00:01:48.619><c> watch</c><00:01:48.799><c> this</c><00:01:49.070><c> summative</c><00:01:49.609><c> video</c>

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
decided to watch this summative video

decided to watch this summative video
and<00:01:50.210><c> I</c><00:01:50.689><c> also</c><00:01:50.869><c> watched</c><00:01:51.259><c> a</c><00:01:51.499><c> crash</c><00:01:51.740><c> course</c>

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 align:start position:0%

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.859 align:start position:0%
and I also watched a crash course
because<00:01:52.490><c> these</c><00:01:52.640><c> are</c><00:01:52.820><c> so</c><00:01:52.999><c> helpful</c><00:01:53.329><c> for</c><00:01:53.659><c> just</c>

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 align:start position:0%
because these are so helpful for just
 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.230 align:start position:0%

around 20 pages but it did take me an
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.870 align:start position:0%
around 20 pages but it did take me an

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
think that it would end up taking me

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
this long I think the issue is is that

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.210 align:start position:0%
so I decided to find a different PDF
document<00:04:32.450><c> which</c><00:04:32.600><c> I</c><00:04:32.750><c> could</c><00:04:32.900><c> highlight</c><00:04:33.220><c> however</c>

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 align:start position:0%

this<00:04:34.370><c> was</c><00:04:34.580><c> a</c><00:04:34.610><c> slightly</c><00:04:34.910><c> different</c>

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 align:start position:0%
this was a slightly different
 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.090 align:start position:0%
this was a slightly different
translation<00:04:35.810><c> so</c><00:04:36.020><c> in</c><00:04:36.110><c> the</c><00:04:36.200><c> end</c><00:04:36.350><c> I</c><00:04:36.590><c> had</c><00:04:36.800><c> to</c><00:04:36.830><c> just</c>

afterwards<00:10:55.150><c> and</c><00:10:55.480><c> I</c><00:10:56.080><c> was</c><00:10:56.740><c> planning</c><00:10:57.040><c> on</c><00:10:57.370><c> working</c>

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:57.580 align:start position:0%

00:10:59.730 --> 00:10:59.740 align:start position:0%
out for maybe an hour but over a weekend
 

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.990 align:start position:0%
out for maybe an hour but over a weekend
I<00:10:59.860><c> think</c><00:10:59.890><c> I</c><00:11:00.160><c> might</c><00:11:00.340><c> have</c><00:11:00.370><c> pulled</c><00:11:00.580><c> a</c><00:11:00.670><c> muscle</c><00:11:00.820><c> in</c>

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
I think I might have pulled a muscle in
 

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.210 align:start position:0%
I think I might have pulled a muscle in
my<00:11:01.150><c> leg</c><00:11:01.180><c> and</c><00:11:01.810><c> I</c><00:11:02.020><c> also</c><00:11:02.260><c> twisted</c><00:11:02.710><c> my</c><00:11:02.800><c> ankle</c>

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.220 align:start position:0%
my leg and I also twisted my ankle
 

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.570 align:start position:0%
my leg and I also twisted my ankle
whilst<00:11:03.550><c> on</c><00:11:03.960><c> this</c><00:11:04.960><c> beach</c><00:11:05.230><c> run</c><00:11:05.560><c> I'm</c><00:11:06.160><c> not</c><00:11:06.370><c> sure</c><00:11:06.520><c> if</c>

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:06.580 align:start position:0%
whilst on this beach run I'm not sure if
 

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
whilst on this beach run I'm not sure if
it's<00:11:06.730><c> because</c><00:11:06.850><c> of</c><00:11:07.060><c> the</c><00:11:07.150><c> resistance</c><00:11:07.450><c> the</c><00:11:07.870><c> sand</c>

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.110 align:start position:0%
it's because of the resistance the sand
 

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's because of the resistance the sand
with<00:11:08.350><c> the</c><00:11:08.440><c> wind</c><00:11:08.650><c> I</c><00:11:08.890><c> don't</c><00:11:08.920><c> know</c><00:11:09.190><c> but</c><00:11:09.910><c> it</c><00:11:10.300><c> really</c>

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:10.690 align:start position:0%
with the wind I don't know but it really
 

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
with the wind I don't know but it really
hurts<00:11:10.990><c> for</c><00:11:11.230><c> me</c><00:11:11.350><c> to</c><00:11:11.470><c> walk</c><00:11:11.650><c> on</c><00:11:11.860><c> it</c><00:11:12.010><c> and</c><00:11:12.160><c> I</c><00:11:12.640><c> thought</c>

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.150 align:start position:0%
hurts for me to walk on it and I thought
 

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
hurts for me to walk on it and I thought
maybe<00:11:13.390><c> if</c><00:11:13.720><c> I</c><00:11:13.840><c> went</c><00:11:13.930><c> to</c><00:11:14.050><c> the</c><00:11:14.140><c> gym</c><00:11:14.290><c> I</c><00:11:14.410><c> could</c>

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.470 align:start position:0%
maybe if I went to the gym I could
 

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
maybe if I went to the gym I could
loosen<00:11:14.890><c> it</c><00:11:15.010><c> up</c><00:11:15.130><c> on</c><00:11:15.340><c> the</c><00:11:15.430><c> treadmill</c><00:11:15.640><c> but</c><00:11:16.090><c> that</c>

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:16.810 align:start position:0%
loosen it up on the treadmill but that
 

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.630 align:start position:0%
loosen it up on the treadmill but that
just<00:11:17.140><c> didn't</c><00:11:17.410><c> happen</c><00:11:17.560><c> so</c><00:11:17.860><c> I</c><00:11:17.920><c> did</c><00:11:18.100><c> ten</c><00:11:18.370><c> minutes</c>

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
just didn't happen so I did ten minutes
 

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.670 align:start position:0%
just didn't happen so I did ten minutes
on<00:11:18.790><c> the</c><00:11:18.940><c> treadmill</c><00:11:19.060><c> but</c><00:11:19.620><c> after</c><00:11:20.620><c> that</c><00:11:20.740><c> I</c><00:11:20.950><c> just</c><00:11:21.370><c> I</c>

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
on the treadmill but after that I just I
 

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
on the treadmill but after that I just I
literally<00:11:23.680><c> couldn't</c><00:11:23.860><c> do</c><00:11:23.980><c> it</c><00:11:24.130><c> anymore</c><00:11:24.370><c> and</c><00:11:24.730><c> I</c>

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:24.790 align:start position:0%
literally couldn't do it anymore and I
 

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
literally couldn't do it anymore and I
was<00:11:24.910><c> limping</c><00:11:25.270><c> the</c><00:11:25.570><c> whole</c><00:11:25.780><c> way</c><00:11:25.960><c> back</c><00:11:26.140><c> to</c><00:11:26.200><c> my</c>

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:26.470 align:start position:0%
was limping the whole way back to my
 

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.890 align:start position:0%
was limping the whole way back to my
room<00:11:26.710><c> so</c><00:11:26.980><c> I</c><00:11:27.370><c> really</c><00:11:27.820><c> regret</c><00:11:28.150><c> doing</c><00:11:28.330><c> that</c><00:11:28.510><c> but</c>

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:28.900 align:start position:0%
room so I really regret doing that but
 

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.650 align:start position:0%

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 align:start position:0%

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.509 align:start position:0%
and then you basically have to train

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 align:start position:0%
yourself to get used to that noise and
 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.370 align:start position:0%
yourself to get used to that noise and
it<00:02:30.120><c> won't</c><00:02:30.300><c> feel</c><00:02:30.480><c> so</c><00:02:30.720><c> abnormal</c><00:02:31.140><c> when</c><00:02:31.260><c> you're</c>

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 align:start position:0%

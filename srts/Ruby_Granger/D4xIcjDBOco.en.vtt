some<00:01:28.170><c> work</c><00:01:28.350><c> in</c><00:01:28.590><c> one</c><00:01:28.770><c> evening</c><00:01:29.009><c> I</c><00:01:29.790><c> kind</c><00:01:30.540><c> of</c>

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 align:start position:0%
some work in one evening I kind of
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
some work in one evening I kind of
brushed<00:01:30.990><c> it</c><00:01:31.200><c> but</c><00:01:31.590><c> I</c><00:01:31.979><c> still</c><00:01:32.670><c> learnt</c><00:01:33.000><c> a</c><00:01:33.180><c> lot</c><00:01:33.360><c> and</c>

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 align:start position:0%
brushed it but I still learnt a lot and
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.219 align:start position:0%
brushed it but I still learnt a lot and
so<00:01:33.960><c> I</c><00:01:34.229><c> don't</c><00:01:34.470><c> think</c><00:01:34.799><c> that</c><00:01:35.549><c> it</c><00:01:35.880><c> was</c><00:01:36.060><c> time</c><00:01:36.630><c> wasted</c>

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that it was time wasted
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that it was time wasted
or<00:01:37.350><c> anything</c><00:01:37.530><c> it</c><00:01:37.860><c> just</c><00:01:38.040><c> really</c><00:01:38.400><c> urged</c><00:01:38.700><c> me</c><00:01:39.060><c> to</c>

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 align:start position:0%
or anything it just really urged me to
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.719 align:start position:0%
or anything it just really urged me to
be<00:01:39.299><c> really</c><00:01:39.810><c> productive</c><00:01:40.020><c> when</c><00:01:40.770><c> I</c><00:01:40.979><c> was</c><00:01:41.369><c> going</c>

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
reading through the articles usually
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.260 align:start position:0%
reading through the articles usually
reading<00:01:50.009><c> the</c><00:01:50.189><c> transcripts</c><00:01:50.790><c> instead</c><00:01:51.149><c> of</c>

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 align:start position:0%
watching the videos because that's
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.650 align:start position:0%
watching the videos because that's

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 align:start position:0%

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
ticked that off my to-do list so I
 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000 align:start position:0%

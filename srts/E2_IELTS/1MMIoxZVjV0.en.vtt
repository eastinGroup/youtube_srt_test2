00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
know I could have answered quite simply
 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.010 align:start position:0%
know I could have answered quite simply

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
or as I tried to do it as you should do
 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.570 align:start position:0%
or as I tried to do it as you should do
is<00:05:25.139><c> try</c><00:05:25.530><c> to</c><00:05:25.650><c> answer</c><00:05:25.860><c> in</c><00:05:26.099><c> a</c><00:05:26.130><c> more</c><00:05:26.310><c> sophisticated</c>

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
is try to answer in a more sophisticated
 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.629 align:start position:0%
is try to answer in a more sophisticated
way<00:05:27.360><c> yeah</c><00:05:27.930><c> and</c><00:05:28.229><c> you</c><00:05:28.410><c> probably</c><00:05:28.860><c> end</c><00:05:29.039><c> up</c><00:05:29.190><c> doing</c><00:05:29.400><c> a</c>

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
way yeah and you probably end up doing a
 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
way yeah and you probably end up doing a
combination<00:05:30.300><c> so</c><00:05:30.479><c> they</c><00:05:30.599><c> might</c><00:05:30.840><c> have</c><00:05:31.020><c> started</c>

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 align:start position:0%
combination so they might have started
 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.700 align:start position:0%
combination so they might have started
by<00:05:31.590><c> asking</c><00:05:32.070><c> what</c><00:05:32.789><c> are</c><00:05:32.820><c> some</c><00:05:33.150><c> ways</c><00:05:33.389><c> that</c>

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 align:start position:0%
by asking what are some ways that
 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
by asking what are some ways that
advertisers<00:05:34.710><c> attract</c><00:05:35.250><c> customers</c><00:05:35.520><c> so</c><00:05:36.150><c> then</c>

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 align:start position:0%
advertisers attract customers so then
 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.700 align:start position:0%
advertisers attract customers so then
you're<00:05:36.530><c> listing</c><00:05:37.530><c> things</c><00:05:38.419><c> billboards</c><00:05:39.419><c> and</c>

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 align:start position:0%
you're listing things billboards and
 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.310 align:start position:0%
you're listing things billboards and

they use jingles and gimmicks and blah
blah<00:05:43.440><c> and</c><00:05:44.070><c> then</c><00:05:44.220><c> it</c><00:05:44.400><c> can</c><00:05:44.550><c> become</c><00:05:44.820><c> a</c><00:05:44.849><c> bit</c><00:05:44.940><c> more</c>

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 align:start position:0%

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:20.390 align:start position:0%
the other hand tend to mature a bit
 

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.750 align:start position:0%
the other hand tend to mature a bit

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.210 align:start position:0%
I've seen a lot of report cards and
people<00:26:08.840><c> often</c><00:26:09.230><c> get</c><00:26:09.350><c> very</c><00:26:09.410><c> low</c><00:26:09.710><c> scores</c><00:26:10.040><c> in</c>

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:10.220 align:start position:0%
people often get very low scores in
 

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.250 align:start position:0%
people often get very low scores in

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:12.260 align:start position:0%

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.690 align:start position:0%
spelling but can still get 90 in writing
so<00:26:12.440><c> the</c><00:26:12.530><c> way</c><00:26:12.710><c> teach</c><00:26:12.950><c> for</c><00:26:13.220><c> spelling</c><00:26:13.490><c> my</c>

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:13.700 align:start position:0%
so the way teach for spelling my
 

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.250 align:start position:0%
so the way teach for spelling my
inference<00:26:14.210><c> is</c><00:26:14.390><c> that</c><00:26:14.420><c> it</c><00:26:14.690><c> doesn't</c><00:26:14.990><c> weigh</c><00:26:15.230><c> very</c>

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:15.260 align:start position:0%
inference is that it doesn't weigh very
 

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
inference is that it doesn't weigh very
much<00:26:15.680><c> in</c><00:26:16.130><c> terms</c><00:26:16.340><c> of</c><00:26:16.520><c> possibly</c><00:26:17.120><c> but</c><00:26:17.360><c> to</c><00:26:17.540><c> me</c>

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:17.690 align:start position:0%
much in terms of possibly but to me
 

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.420 align:start position:0%
much in terms of possibly but to me
consciously<00:26:18.260><c> I</c><00:26:18.410><c> think</c><00:26:18.710><c> that's</c><00:26:18.890><c> that's</c><00:26:19.220><c> the</c>

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:19.430 align:start position:0%
consciously I think that's that's the
 

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
consciously I think that's that's the

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:24.470 align:start position:0%

it<00:26:26.840><c> doesn't</c><00:26:27.170><c> carry</c><00:26:27.350><c> much</c><00:26:27.410><c> weight</c><00:26:27.560><c> is</c><00:26:27.890><c> because</c>

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:28.220 align:start position:0%
it doesn't carry much weight is because
 

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.590 align:start position:0%

been eight point five or nine so it's
and<00:28:39.210><c> that</c><00:28:39.240><c> means</c><00:28:39.690><c> you've</c><00:28:39.870><c> missed</c><00:28:40.020><c> one</c>

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:40.350 align:start position:0%

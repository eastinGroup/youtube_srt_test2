yeah yeah yeah I cheated a little bit
 

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.100 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah I cheated a little bit
cuz<00:10:49.829><c> I</c><00:10:49.889><c> could</c><00:10:50.040><c> see</c><00:10:50.459><c> the</c><00:10:50.699><c> clock</c><00:10:51.029><c> there</c><00:10:51.360><c> mmm</c><00:10:52.019><c> and</c>

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.110 align:start position:0%
cuz I could see the clock there mmm and
 

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.500 align:start position:0%

00:14:27.929 --> 00:14:27.939 align:start position:0%
noticed I worked through each point and
 

00:14:27.939 --> 00:14:30.030 align:start position:0%
noticed I worked through each point and
tried<00:14:28.149><c> to</c><00:14:28.180><c> extend</c><00:14:28.750><c> an</c><00:14:28.959><c> x-man</c><00:14:29.350><c> just</c><00:14:29.680><c> strap</c>

elated I brought in other aspects and
 

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.819 align:start position:0%

then<00:14:33.629><c> probably</c><00:14:34.629><c> for</c><00:14:34.870><c> me</c><00:14:34.990><c> the</c><00:14:35.019><c> key</c><00:14:35.350><c> is</c><00:14:35.379><c> that</c><00:14:35.800><c> I</c>

00:14:35.819 --> 00:14:35.829 align:start position:0%
then probably for me the key is that I
 

00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
then probably for me the key is that I

and it looked like it was a really

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 align:start position:0%
comfortable and nice environment so I
 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.460 align:start position:0%
comfortable and nice environment so I
was<00:03:56.250><c> yeah</c><00:03:56.970><c> just</c><00:03:57.269><c> curious</c><00:03:57.660><c> interested</c><00:03:58.049><c> pose</c>

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 align:start position:0%
was yeah just curious interested pose
 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.339 align:start position:0%
was yeah just curious interested pose
and<00:03:58.950><c> part</c><00:03:59.400><c> of</c><00:03:59.519><c> being</c><00:04:00.329><c> a</c><00:04:00.480><c> teacher</c><00:04:00.720><c> I</c><00:04:00.900><c> guess</c><00:04:01.169><c> is</c>

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 align:start position:0%
and part of being a teacher I guess is
 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
and part of being a teacher I guess is
to<00:04:01.560><c> really</c><00:04:01.739><c> experience</c><00:04:02.370><c> it</c><00:04:02.549><c> from</c><00:04:02.760><c> the</c>

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 align:start position:0%
candidates point of view and yeah I
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.110 align:start position:0%
candidates point of view and yeah I
think<00:04:06.660><c> that's</c><00:04:06.989><c> important</c><00:04:07.500><c> so</c><00:04:07.709><c> my</c><00:04:08.340><c> motivations</c>

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
think that's important so my motivations
 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.050 align:start position:0%
think that's important so my motivations
were<00:04:09.359><c> pretty</c><00:04:09.810><c> much</c><00:04:09.989><c> the</c><00:04:10.260><c> same</c><00:04:10.470><c> one</c><00:04:11.220><c> other</c>

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 align:start position:0%
motivation perhaps though was that
 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.490 align:start position:0%
motivation perhaps though was that

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:37.069 align:start position:0%
it's Kahneman his surname he seems to be
 

00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:39.250 align:start position:0%
it's Kahneman his surname he seems to be
an<00:13:37.160><c> IELTS</c><00:13:37.550><c> darling</c><00:13:38.209><c> appears</c><00:13:38.569><c> in</c><00:13:38.750><c> a</c><00:13:38.839><c> few</c><00:13:39.019><c> ticks</c>

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:39.260 align:start position:0%
an IELTS darling appears in a few ticks
 

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
an IELTS darling appears in a few ticks
and<00:13:39.529><c> then</c><00:13:39.769><c> the</c><00:13:40.370><c> final</c><00:13:40.760><c> reading</c><00:13:41.060><c> was</c><00:13:41.180><c> about</c>

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:41.209 align:start position:0%
and then the final reading was about
 

00:13:41.209 --> 00:13:45.550 align:start position:0%
and then the final reading was about
Mars<00:13:41.839><c> and</c><00:13:43.180><c> so</c><00:13:44.180><c> I</c><00:13:44.480><c> think</c><00:13:44.779><c> we</c><00:13:44.959><c> covered</c><00:13:45.170><c> quite</c><00:13:45.440><c> a</c>

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
Mars and so I think we covered quite a
 

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.790 align:start position:0%
Mars and so I think we covered quite a

theoretically the first test and the

theoretically the first test and the

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:55.850 align:start position:0%
first reading text should be easiest
 

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.370 align:start position:0%
first reading text should be easiest
there's<00:13:56.240><c> one</c><00:13:56.449><c> a</c><00:13:56.480><c> little</c><00:13:56.660><c> bit</c><00:13:56.870><c> harder</c><00:13:57.199><c> and</c><00:13:57.230><c> the</c>

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:57.380 align:start position:0%
there's one a little bit harder and the
 

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.559 align:start position:0%
there's one a little bit harder and the
last<00:13:57.589><c> one</c><00:13:57.829><c> should</c><00:13:57.980><c> be</c><00:13:58.190><c> much</c><00:13:58.399><c> harder</c><00:13:58.699><c> and</c><00:13:59.180><c> yet</c>

00:13:59.559 --> 00:13:59.569 align:start position:0%
last one should be much harder and yet

they're<00:14:01.399><c> not</c><00:14:01.550><c> always</c><00:14:01.730><c> like</c><00:14:02.149><c> that</c><00:14:02.180><c> but</c><00:14:02.600><c> in</c><00:14:02.690><c> my</c>

they're not always like that but in my

they're not always like that but in my

00:14:10.569 --> 00:14:10.579 align:start position:0%
in the middle one yes so so yeah also
 

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:14.710 align:start position:0%
in the middle one yes so so yeah also
like<00:14:10.819><c> that</c><00:14:11.029><c> as</c><00:14:11.209><c> well</c><00:14:11.420><c> ah</c><00:14:13.000><c> I'm</c><00:14:14.000><c> not</c><00:14:14.060><c> sure</c><00:14:14.240><c> that</c><00:14:14.449><c> I</c>

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
like that as well ah I'm not sure that I
 

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.189 align:start position:0%
like that as well ah I'm not sure that I
found<00:14:15.620><c> them</c><00:14:16.160><c> I</c><00:14:16.810><c> didn't</c><00:14:17.810><c> really</c><00:14:17.959><c> feel</c><00:14:18.139><c> like</c>

00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
found them I didn't really feel like
 

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:20.889 align:start position:0%
found them I didn't really feel like
they<00:14:18.470><c> went</c><00:14:18.649><c> in</c><00:14:18.829><c> that</c><00:14:18.980><c> order</c><00:14:19.190><c> I've</c><00:14:19.610><c> also</c><00:14:19.899><c> heard</c>

00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:20.899 align:start position:0%
they went in that order I've also heard
 

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:22.569 align:start position:0%
they went in that order I've also heard
that<00:14:20.959><c> that</c><00:14:21.589><c> it</c><00:14:21.709><c> goes</c><00:14:21.829><c> from</c><00:14:21.889><c> easy</c><00:14:22.310><c> to</c><00:14:22.459><c> difficult</c>

00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:22.579 align:start position:0%
that that it goes from easy to difficult
 

00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:25.629 align:start position:0%
that that it goes from easy to difficult
but<00:14:23.180><c> I</c><00:14:23.420><c> agree</c><00:14:24.079><c> in</c><00:14:24.380><c> the</c><00:14:24.529><c> practice</c><00:14:24.889><c> test</c><00:14:25.130><c> I</c><00:14:25.310><c> feel</c>

00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
but I agree in the practice test I feel
 

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:27.550 align:start position:0%
but I agree in the practice test I feel
like<00:14:25.759><c> it</c><00:14:25.940><c> varies</c><00:14:26.389><c> and</c><00:14:26.630><c> maybe</c><00:14:26.779><c> it</c><00:14:27.139><c> comes</c><00:14:27.380><c> down</c>

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
like it varies and maybe it comes down
 

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.949 align:start position:0%
like it varies and maybe it comes down
at<00:14:27.769><c> it</c><00:14:27.860><c> to</c><00:14:28.100><c> your</c><00:14:28.970><c> background</c><00:14:29.180><c> what</c><00:14:29.569><c> you</c><00:14:29.690><c> know</c>

00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
at it to your background what you know
 

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:31.780 align:start position:0%
at it to your background what you know
about<00:14:30.110><c> what</c><00:14:30.319><c> you're</c><00:14:30.589><c> interested</c><00:14:30.860><c> in</c><00:14:31.190><c> and</c><00:14:31.370><c> the</c>

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:31.790 align:start position:0%
about what you're interested in and the
 

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.150 align:start position:0%
about what you're interested in and the

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.050 align:start position:0%

usually<00:14:34.430><c> a</c><00:14:35.170><c> kind</c><00:14:36.170><c> of</c><00:14:36.259><c> an</c><00:14:36.380><c> argumentative</c><00:14:37.060><c> piece</c>

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:38.060 align:start position:0%

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
little bit of information but then go
 

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
little bit of information but then go

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:33.649 align:start position:0%
straight to the questions and I found
 

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
straight to the questions and I found
that<00:15:33.769><c> really</c><00:15:33.949><c> valuable</c><00:15:34.370><c> so</c><00:15:34.670><c> for</c><00:15:35.060><c> example</c><00:15:35.360><c> the</c>

00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:35.449 align:start position:0%
that really valuable so for example the
 

00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:37.030 align:start position:0%
that really valuable so for example the
first<00:15:35.600><c> one</c><00:15:35.720><c> was</c><00:15:35.990><c> about</c><00:15:36.110><c> nuggets</c><00:15:36.709><c> and</c><00:15:36.889><c> when</c><00:15:37.009><c> I</c>

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
first one was about nuggets and when I
 

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.980 align:start position:0%
first one was about nuggets and when I
went<00:15:37.279><c> through</c><00:15:37.310><c> the</c><00:15:37.519><c> questions</c><00:15:37.639><c> I</c><00:15:38.240><c> realized</c>

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:38.990 align:start position:0%
went through the questions I realized
 

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.660 align:start position:0%
went through the questions I realized
that<00:15:39.079><c> most</c><00:15:39.290><c> of</c><00:15:39.439><c> the</c><00:15:39.529><c> questions</c><00:15:39.980><c> were</c><00:15:40.220><c> focused</c>

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:40.670 align:start position:0%
that most of the questions were focused
 

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
that most of the questions were focused
on<00:15:40.990><c> particular</c><00:15:41.990><c> nuggets</c><00:15:42.620><c> how</c><00:15:42.800><c> big</c><00:15:43.009><c> they</c><00:15:43.189><c> were</c>

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:43.250 align:start position:0%
on particular nuggets how big they were
 

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
on particular nuggets how big they were
when<00:15:43.670><c> they</c><00:15:43.850><c> were</c><00:15:43.910><c> discovered</c><00:15:44.569><c> and</c><00:15:44.750><c> so</c><00:15:44.959><c> the</c>

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:46.630 align:start position:0%
when they were discovered and so the
 

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.970 align:start position:0%
when they were discovered and so the
organizational<00:15:47.630><c> principle</c><00:15:48.230><c> was</c><00:15:48.410><c> the</c><00:15:48.439><c> name</c><00:15:48.949><c> of</c>

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:48.980 align:start position:0%
organizational principle was the name of
 

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
organizational principle was the name of
the<00:15:49.339><c> Nuggets</c><00:15:49.579><c> so</c><00:15:50.029><c> then</c><00:15:50.209><c> when</c><00:15:50.449><c> I</c><00:15:50.480><c> went</c><00:15:50.779><c> through</c>

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:50.930 align:start position:0%
the Nuggets so then when I went through
 

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.929 align:start position:0%
the Nuggets so then when I went through
later<00:15:51.410><c> and</c><00:15:51.709><c> read</c><00:15:51.860><c> the</c><00:15:52.040><c> text</c><00:15:52.430><c> I</c><00:15:52.579><c> just</c>

00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:52.939 align:start position:0%
later and read the text I just
 

00:15:52.939 --> 00:15:55.269 align:start position:0%
later and read the text I just
immediately<00:15:53.360><c> underlined</c><00:15:54.050><c> the</c><00:15:54.680><c> names</c><00:15:54.949><c> of</c><00:15:55.189><c> the</c>

00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
immediately underlined the names of the
 

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:57.579 align:start position:0%
immediately underlined the names of the
Nuggets<00:15:55.519><c> and</c><00:15:55.939><c> that</c><00:15:56.149><c> meant</c><00:15:56.420><c> I</c><00:15:56.660><c> could</c><00:15:57.259><c> then</c><00:15:57.410><c> go</c>

00:15:57.579 --> 00:15:57.589 align:start position:0%
Nuggets and that meant I could then go
 

00:15:57.589 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
Nuggets and that meant I could then go
to<00:15:57.649><c> a</c><00:15:57.800><c> question</c><00:15:58.069><c> and</c><00:15:58.610><c> quickly</c><00:15:59.420><c> find</c><00:15:59.810><c> where</c><00:16:00.050><c> the</c>

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.170 align:start position:0%
to a question and quickly find where the
 

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.710 align:start position:0%
to a question and quickly find where the
answer<00:16:00.560><c> was</c><00:16:00.740><c> and</c><00:16:01.639><c> so</c><00:16:01.819><c> we've</c><00:16:02.060><c> been</c><00:16:02.209><c> teaching</c><00:16:02.449><c> a</c>

answer was and so we've been teaching a
 

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.500 align:start position:0%
answer was and so we've been teaching a
really<00:16:03.050><c> good</c><00:16:03.259><c> strategy</c><00:16:03.850><c> I</c><00:16:04.850><c> found</c><00:16:05.240><c> it</c><00:16:05.329><c> really</c>

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:05.510 align:start position:0%
really good strategy I found it really
 

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.439 align:start position:0%

use<00:16:30.180><c> a</c><00:16:30.209><c> combination</c><00:16:30.870><c> of</c><00:16:31.319><c> strategies</c><00:16:31.379><c> that's</c>

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
use a combination of strategies that's
 

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.869 align:start position:0%
use a combination of strategies that's
certainly<00:16:32.490><c> one</c><00:16:32.730><c> of</c><00:16:32.759><c> them</c><00:16:33.029><c> I</c><00:16:33.300><c> also</c><00:16:34.100><c> I</c><00:16:35.100><c> look</c><00:16:35.759><c> at</c>

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:35.879 align:start position:0%
certainly one of them I also I look at
 

00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:38.300 align:start position:0%
certainly one of them I also I look at
the<00:16:36.000><c> question</c><00:16:36.420><c> type</c><00:16:36.959><c> and</c><00:16:37.500><c> so</c><00:16:37.709><c> if</c><00:16:37.860><c> I</c><00:16:38.009><c> see</c><00:16:38.279><c> a</c>

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:38.310 align:start position:0%
the question type and so if I see a
 

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.910 align:start position:0%
the question type and so if I see a
headings<00:16:38.850><c> match</c><00:16:39.120><c> or</c><00:16:39.540><c> an</c><00:16:39.930><c> information</c><00:16:40.259><c> match</c>

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
headings match or an information match
 

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.629 align:start position:0%

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
type question I tell myself ok I've got
 

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:46.129 align:start position:0%
type question I tell myself ok I've got
to<00:16:44.670><c> read</c><00:16:44.910><c> everything</c><00:16:45.300><c> cuz</c><00:16:45.689><c> that</c><00:16:45.870><c> type</c><00:16:46.110><c> of</c>

00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
to read everything cuz that type of
 

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:50.119 align:start position:0%
to read everything cuz that type of
question<00:16:46.879><c> doesn't</c><00:16:48.199><c> reward</c><00:16:49.199><c> skimming</c><00:16:50.009><c> and</c>

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:50.129 align:start position:0%
question doesn't reward skimming and
 

00:16:50.129 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
question doesn't reward skimming and
scanning<00:16:50.189><c> it's</c><00:16:50.819><c> more</c><00:16:51.089><c> about</c><00:16:51.240><c> careful</c><00:16:51.720><c> reading</c>

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.050 align:start position:0%
scanning it's more about careful reading
 

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.740 align:start position:0%
scanning it's more about careful reading
so<00:16:52.230><c> when</c><00:16:52.350><c> I</c><00:16:52.379><c> see</c><00:16:52.680><c> that</c><00:16:52.860><c> type</c><00:16:53.069><c> of</c><00:16:53.100><c> question</c><00:16:53.750><c> I</c>

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:54.750 align:start position:0%
so when I see that type of question I
 

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
so when I see that type of question I
look<00:16:55.319><c> at</c><00:16:55.439><c> all</c><00:16:55.560><c> the</c><00:16:55.680><c> other</c><00:16:55.709><c> questions</c><00:16:56.339><c> and</c><00:16:56.639><c> note</c>

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:56.850 align:start position:0%
look at all the other questions and note
 

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
look at all the other questions and note
the<00:16:57.029><c> keywords</c><00:16:57.449><c> and</c><00:16:57.720><c> then</c><00:16:57.899><c> I</c><00:16:58.019><c> go</c><00:16:58.529><c> through</c>

00:16:59.199 --> 00:16:59.209 align:start position:0%
the keywords and then I go through
 

00:16:59.209 --> 00:17:01.670 align:start position:0%
the keywords and then I go through
paragraph<00:17:00.209><c> by</c><00:17:00.420><c> paragraph</c><00:17:00.449><c> so</c><00:17:01.110><c> I</c><00:17:01.170><c> start</c><00:17:01.500><c> by</c>

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph by paragraph so I start by
 

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.090 align:start position:0%
paragraph by paragraph so I start by
reading<00:17:01.889><c> paragraph</c><00:17:02.430><c> a</c><00:17:02.550><c> and</c><00:17:03.380><c> choose</c><00:17:04.380><c> a</c><00:17:04.740><c> heading</c>

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
reading paragraph a and choose a heading
 

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.919 align:start position:0%
reading paragraph a and choose a heading
or<00:17:05.250><c> choose</c><00:17:05.520><c> a</c><00:17:05.549><c> piece</c><00:17:05.850><c> of</c><00:17:06.000><c> information</c><00:17:06.240><c> or</c><00:17:06.689><c> two</c>

00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:06.929 align:start position:0%
or choose a piece of information or two
 

00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:08.990 align:start position:0%
or choose a piece of information or two
and<00:17:07.319><c> then</c><00:17:07.679><c> at</c><00:17:07.799><c> the</c><00:17:07.890><c> same</c><00:17:08.069><c> time</c><00:17:08.280><c> I</c><00:17:08.309><c> see</c><00:17:08.610><c> if</c><00:17:08.730><c> I</c><00:17:08.819><c> can</c>

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
and then at the same time I see if I can
 

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
and then at the same time I see if I can
answer<00:17:09.150><c> the</c><00:17:09.539><c> other</c><00:17:09.569><c> questions</c><00:17:10.169><c> I</c><00:17:10.350><c> guess</c><00:17:10.589><c> no</c>

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:10.770 align:start position:0%
answer the other questions I guess no
 

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
answer the other questions I guess no
not<00:17:10.949><c> given</c><00:17:11.100><c> or</c><00:17:11.929><c> some</c><00:17:12.929><c> other</c><00:17:13.049><c> kind</c><00:17:13.319><c> of</c>

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%

questions out of order that you're sort

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:26.539 align:start position:0%
of doing the matching it but at the same
time<00:17:25.079><c> you</c><00:17:25.350><c> keep</c><00:17:25.589><c> an</c><00:17:25.740><c> eye</c><00:17:25.860><c> on</c><00:17:26.039><c> the</c><00:17:26.130><c> true</c><00:17:26.339><c> false</c>

00:17:26.539 --> 00:17:26.549 align:start position:0%
time you keep an eye on the true false
 

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:28.610 align:start position:0%
time you keep an eye on the true false
not<00:17:26.669><c> given</c><00:17:26.819><c> or</c><00:17:27.209><c> whatever</c><00:17:27.539><c> yeah</c><00:17:27.929><c> yep</c>

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
not given or whatever yeah yep
 

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.220 align:start position:0%

so<00:17:28.919><c> if</c><00:17:29.190><c> I</c><00:17:29.309><c> have</c><00:17:29.549><c> to</c><00:17:29.820><c> read</c><00:17:30.179><c> the</c><00:17:30.390><c> paragraph</c><00:17:30.570><c> to</c>

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:31.230 align:start position:0%
so if I have to read the paragraph to
 

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.990 align:start position:0%
so if I have to read the paragraph to
match<00:17:31.440><c> the</c><00:17:31.679><c> heading</c><00:17:31.980><c> I</c><00:17:32.250><c> don't</c><00:17:32.610><c> want</c><00:17:32.760><c> to</c><00:17:32.850><c> read</c>

it<00:17:33.030><c> again</c><00:17:33.299><c> to</c><00:17:33.720><c> do</c><00:17:33.900><c> the</c><00:17:34.409><c> next</c><00:17:34.620><c> set</c><00:17:34.830><c> of</c><00:17:34.860><c> questions</c>

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:35.070 align:start position:0%
it again to do the next set of questions

so<00:17:35.490><c> I</c><00:17:35.520><c> try</c><00:17:35.850><c> to</c><00:17:35.880><c> just</c><00:17:36.659><c> maximize</c><00:17:37.289><c> my</c><00:17:37.530><c> efficiency</c>

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:38.190 align:start position:0%

for me that step-by-step strategy is

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
4 which are the more difficult ones I
used<00:25:23.960><c> those</c><00:25:24.200><c> gaps</c><00:25:24.560><c> in</c><00:25:24.860><c> part</c><00:25:25.280><c> 1</c><00:25:25.460><c> and</c><00:25:25.640><c> 2</c><00:25:25.820><c> to</c><00:25:26.120><c> just</c>

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:26.570 align:start position:0%
used those gaps in part 1 and 2 to just
 

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.060 align:start position:0%
used those gaps in part 1 and 2 to just
look<00:25:26.750><c> through</c><00:25:26.930><c> them</c><00:25:27.140><c> through</c><00:25:27.530><c> and</c><00:25:27.800><c> see</c><00:25:27.950><c> what</c>

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.070 align:start position:0%
look through them through and see what
 

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
look through them through and see what
the<00:25:28.160><c> topic</c><00:25:28.490><c> was</c><00:25:28.520><c> what</c><00:25:28.700><c> type</c><00:25:29.180><c> of</c><00:25:29.210><c> questions</c>

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:29.810 align:start position:0%
the topic was what type of questions
 

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.750 align:start position:0%
the topic was what type of questions
particularly<00:25:30.680><c> looking</c><00:25:31.100><c> for</c><00:25:31.280><c> a</c><00:25:31.310><c> multiple</c>

choice which have so much text in them
 

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:39.810 align:start position:0%

so yeah yeah that's interesting yeah I
 

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.990 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah that's interesting yeah I
found<00:25:40.820><c> the</c><00:25:41.030><c> listening</c><00:25:41.890><c> fairly</c><00:25:42.890><c> easy</c><00:25:43.400><c> I</c><00:25:43.640><c> must</c>

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
found the listening fairly easy I must
 

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.090 align:start position:0%
found the listening fairly easy I must
say<00:25:44.150><c> there</c><00:25:44.360><c> was</c><00:25:44.450><c> but</c><00:25:45.020><c> there's</c><00:25:45.260><c> one</c><00:25:45.500><c> question</c><00:25:45.800><c> I</c>

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:46.100 align:start position:0%
say there was but there's one question I
 

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.150 align:start position:0%
say there was but there's one question I
think<00:25:46.160><c> that</c><00:25:46.400><c> I</c><00:25:47.260><c> second-guessed</c><00:25:48.260><c> myself</c><00:25:48.590><c> but</c>

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
think that I second-guessed myself but
 

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
think that I second-guessed myself but
otherwise<00:25:49.430><c> I</c><00:25:49.760><c> felt</c><00:25:50.090><c> that</c><00:25:50.330><c> I</c><00:25:50.390><c> was</c><00:25:50.660><c> very</c><00:25:50.930><c> well</c>

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:51.770 align:start position:0%
otherwise I felt that I was very well
 

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.890 align:start position:0%
otherwise I felt that I was very well
prepared<00:25:52.280><c> I</c><00:25:52.460><c> knew</c><00:25:52.610><c> exactly</c><00:25:52.970><c> what</c><00:25:53.300><c> to</c><00:25:53.450><c> expect</c>

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:53.900 align:start position:0%
prepared I knew exactly what to expect
 

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
prepared I knew exactly what to expect
in<00:25:54.140><c> part</c><00:25:55.100><c> 1</c><00:25:55.250><c> 2</c><00:25:55.520><c> 3</c><00:25:55.760><c> 4</c><00:25:56.150><c> it</c><00:25:56.630><c> always</c><00:25:56.990><c> follows</c><00:25:57.440><c> the</c>

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:57.650 align:start position:0%
in part 1 2 3 4 it always follows the
 

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.460 align:start position:0%
in part 1 2 3 4 it always follows the
same<00:25:58.270><c> system</c><00:25:59.270><c> which</c><00:25:59.510><c> we</c><00:25:59.690><c> cover</c><00:25:59.960><c> just</c>

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:00.470 align:start position:0%
same system which we cover just
 

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.490 align:start position:0%
same system which we cover just
endlessly<00:26:01.070><c> in</c><00:26:01.340><c> our</c><00:26:01.490><c> life</c><00:26:01.760><c> classes</c><00:26:02.360><c> and</c><00:26:03.350><c> so</c>

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:03.500 align:start position:0%
endlessly in our life classes and so
 

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.990 align:start position:0%
endlessly in our life classes and so
there<00:26:03.620><c> were</c><00:26:03.680><c> no</c><00:26:03.860><c> surprises</c><00:26:04.130><c> and</c><00:26:04.580><c> I</c><00:26:04.610><c> think</c><00:26:04.820><c> that</c>

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
there were no surprises and I think that
 

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
there were no surprises and I think that
would<00:26:05.210><c> be</c><00:26:05.240><c> a</c><00:26:05.470><c> something</c><00:26:06.470><c> for</c><00:26:06.620><c> people</c><00:26:07.010><c> to</c><00:26:07.130><c> be</c>

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:07.250 align:start position:0%
would be a something for people to be
 

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.130 align:start position:0%
would be a something for people to be

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.160 align:start position:0%

going to hear a lecture in part 4 it's
 

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.140 align:start position:0%
going to hear a lecture in part 4 it's

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:14.150 align:start position:0%

test day yeah I thought the same thing
that<00:26:24.980><c> it</c><00:26:25.640><c> went</c><00:26:26.030><c> as</c><00:26:26.360><c> expected</c><00:26:26.900><c> and</c><00:26:27.290><c> the</c><00:26:27.620><c> only</c>

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
that it went as expected and the only

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.090 align:start position:0%
thing that didn't go right was me
reading<00:26:30.860><c> ahead</c><00:26:30.980><c> and</c><00:26:31.930><c> my</c><00:26:32.930><c> scoring</c><00:26:33.800><c> that</c><00:26:33.950><c> you're</c>

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:34.100 align:start position:0%
reading ahead and my scoring that you're
 

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.150 align:start position:0%
reading ahead and my scoring that you're
about<00:26:34.280><c> to</c><00:26:34.340><c> ask</c><00:26:34.490><c> so</c><00:26:35.150><c> I'll</c><00:26:35.210><c> tell</c><00:26:35.450><c> you</c><00:26:35.480><c> anyway</c><00:26:36.160><c> 8.5</c>

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:38.810 align:start position:0%
and it was probably because I made a

increasing<00:36:23.010><c> consumption</c><00:36:23.520><c> of</c><00:36:23.820><c> consumer</c><00:36:24.480><c> goods</c>

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:24.510 align:start position:0%
increasing consumption of consumer goods
 

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
increasing consumption of consumer goods
and<00:36:25.430><c> that's</c><00:36:26.430><c> degrading</c><00:36:26.700><c> the</c><00:36:27.180><c> environment</c><00:36:27.210><c> and</c>

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.050 align:start position:0%
and that's degrading the environment and
 

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
and that's degrading the environment and
the<00:36:28.560><c> question</c><00:36:29.040><c> was</c><00:36:29.340><c> why</c><00:36:30.000><c> is</c><00:36:30.060><c> that</c><00:36:30.240><c> the</c><00:36:30.540><c> case</c>

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:30.570 align:start position:0%
the question was why is that the case
 

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.140 align:start position:0%
the question was why is that the case
and<00:36:30.780><c> what</c><00:36:31.320><c> can</c><00:36:31.530><c> we</c><00:36:31.650><c> do</c><00:36:31.800><c> about</c><00:36:31.950><c> it</c><00:36:32.340><c> so</c><00:36:32.730><c> it's</c><00:36:33.000><c> a</c>

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:33.150 align:start position:0%
and what can we do about it so it's a
 

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
and what can we do about it so it's a

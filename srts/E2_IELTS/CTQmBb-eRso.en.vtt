completely different thing and have you

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
i can explain why if you consider that
 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.710 align:start position:0%
i can explain why if you consider that
in<00:07:58.879><c> task</c><00:07:59.280><c> two</c><00:07:59.520><c> you</c><00:07:59.680><c> have</c><00:07:59.919><c> an</c><00:08:00.080><c> average</c>

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
in task two you have an average
 

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.830 align:start position:0%
in task two you have an average
nine<00:08:01.039><c> different</c><00:08:01.440><c> types</c><00:08:02.400><c> right</c><00:08:03.520><c> if</c><00:08:03.680><c> the</c>

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
nine different types right if the
 

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.670 align:start position:0%
nine different types right if the
student<00:08:04.240><c> is</c><00:08:04.319><c> taking</c><00:08:04.720><c> the</c><00:08:04.800><c> academic</c>

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
student is taking the academic
 

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.629 align:start position:0%
student is taking the academic
then<00:08:05.919><c> he</c><00:08:06.080><c> has</c><00:08:06.560><c> another</c><00:08:07.680><c> eight</c><00:08:08.240><c> different</c>

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
then he has another eight different
 

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.230 align:start position:0%
then he has another eight different
types<00:08:08.960><c> in</c><00:08:09.120><c> academic</c><00:08:09.759><c> writing</c>

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
types in academic writing
 

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.189 align:start position:0%
types in academic writing
so<00:08:10.720><c> that</c><00:08:10.879><c> means</c><00:08:11.759><c> 20</c><00:08:12.240><c> is</c><00:08:12.319><c> just</c><00:08:12.479><c> like</c><00:08:12.800><c> one</c><00:08:13.039><c> of</c>

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
so that means 20 is just like one of
 

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:13.589 align:start position:0%
so that means 20 is just like one of
each

00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
each
 

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:16.469 align:start position:0%

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
right it's even not even enough honestly
 

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:17.430 align:start position:0%
right it's even not even enough honestly

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.950 align:start position:0%
speaking right
one<00:08:17.680><c> of</c><00:08:17.840><c> each</c><00:08:18.879><c> so</c><00:08:19.440><c> i</c><00:08:19.599><c> always</c><00:08:19.919><c> say</c><00:08:20.319><c> you</c><00:08:20.560><c> need</c><00:08:20.800><c> to</c>

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
one of each so i always say you need to
 

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.749 align:start position:0%
one of each so i always say you need to

in order to really see progress so
 

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
in order to really see progress so
as<00:08:33.200><c> i</c><00:08:33.279><c> say</c><00:08:33.440><c> i</c><00:08:33.599><c> don't</c><00:08:33.760><c> like</c><00:08:33.919><c> to</c><00:08:34.000><c> give</c><00:08:34.240><c> numbers</c>

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
as i say i don't like to give numbers
 

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.310 align:start position:0%
as i say i don't like to give numbers
but<00:08:34.719><c> i</c><00:08:34.880><c> think</c><00:08:35.039><c> that</c><00:08:35.200><c> it's</c><00:08:35.440><c> very</c><00:08:35.919><c> easy</c><00:08:36.159><c> to</c>

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
but i think that it's very easy to
 

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.750 align:start position:0%
but i think that it's very easy to
understand<00:08:36.719><c> at</c><00:08:36.880><c> least</c><00:08:37.120><c> 20</c>

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.230 align:start position:0%
understand at least 20
you<00:08:37.919><c> know</c><00:08:38.080><c> if</c><00:08:38.159><c> you're</c><00:08:38.800><c> an</c><00:08:38.959><c> academic</c><00:08:39.839><c> a</c><00:08:40.000><c> test</c>

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know if you're an academic a test
 

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.269 align:start position:0%
you know if you're an academic a test
taker

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
taker
 

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:44.310 align:start position:0%
taker
and<00:08:41.440><c> if</c><00:08:41.599><c> you're</c><00:08:41.760><c> a</c><00:08:41.919><c> general</c><00:08:42.880><c> at</c><00:08:43.120><c> least</c><00:08:43.360><c> like</c><00:08:43.599><c> 15</c>

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
and if you're a general at least like 15
 

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.430 align:start position:0%
and if you're a general at least like 15
would<00:08:44.560><c> be</c><00:08:45.200><c> minimum</c><00:08:46.320><c> yeah</c><00:08:46.720><c> but</c><00:08:46.959><c> of</c><00:08:47.120><c> course</c>

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
would be minimum yeah but of course
 

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
would be minimum yeah but of course
double<00:08:47.839><c> would</c><00:08:48.000><c> be</c><00:08:48.640><c> the</c><00:08:48.800><c> perfect</c><00:08:49.200><c> number</c>

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
double would be the perfect number
 

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.509 align:start position:0%
double would be the perfect number

because that would give you a chance
 

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:53.509 align:start position:0%
because that would give you a chance

okay<00:15:06.800><c> so</c><00:15:07.120><c> basically</c><00:15:08.000><c> she</c><00:15:08.560><c> really</c><00:15:08.959><c> wasn't</c>

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
her grammar mistakes i mean
 

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:16.949 align:start position:0%
her grammar mistakes i mean
she<00:15:14.240><c> had</c><00:15:14.480><c> never</c><00:15:14.720><c> had</c><00:15:15.040><c> any</c><00:15:15.199><c> kind</c><00:15:15.440><c> of</c><00:15:15.839><c> feedback</c>

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
she had never had any kind of feedback
 

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:18.470 align:start position:0%
she had never had any kind of feedback
so<00:15:17.199><c> that</c><00:15:17.360><c> was</c><00:15:17.600><c> something</c><00:15:17.920><c> that</c><00:15:18.079><c> i</c><00:15:18.160><c> think</c><00:15:18.320><c> that</c>

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
so that was something that i think that
 

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.710 align:start position:0%
so that was something that i think that
was<00:15:18.720><c> lagging</c><00:15:19.120><c> for</c><00:15:19.440><c> her</c><00:15:19.839><c> so</c><00:15:20.079><c> she</c><00:15:20.240><c> had</c><00:15:20.399><c> high</c>

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
grammatical and lexical errors so that
 

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.189 align:start position:0%

they feel that they're just not
they're<00:27:23.600><c> stuck</c><00:27:24.399><c> use</c><00:27:24.640><c> the</c><00:27:24.799><c> simple</c><00:27:25.279><c> sentence</c>

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
they're stuck use the simple sentence
 

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.190 align:start position:0%
they're stuck use the simple sentence
uh<00:27:26.880><c> because</c><00:27:27.279><c> we</c><00:27:27.520><c> need</c><00:27:28.159><c> several</c><00:27:28.480><c> structures</c>

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh because we need several structures
 

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.190 align:start position:0%
uh because we need several structures
and<00:27:29.360><c> simple</c><00:27:29.760><c> structures</c><00:27:30.320><c> we</c><00:27:30.480><c> also</c><00:27:30.720><c> need</c>

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
and simple structures we also need
 

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.029 align:start position:0%
and simple structures we also need
so<00:27:31.440><c> suddenly</c><00:27:31.760><c> they</c><00:27:31.919><c> shouldn't</c><00:27:32.240><c> get</c><00:27:32.480><c> stuck</c>

00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
so suddenly they shouldn't get stuck
 

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:34.230 align:start position:0%
so suddenly they shouldn't get stuck
they<00:27:33.200><c> should</c>

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
they should
 

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.710 align:start position:0%
they should

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
and they they can develop the paragraph
 

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.070 align:start position:0%
and they they can develop the paragraph
and<00:27:41.200><c> even</c><00:27:41.440><c> go</c><00:27:41.679><c> back</c>

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
and even go back

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
principles are doing the computer base
 

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.909 align:start position:0%
principles are doing the computer base
go<00:27:44.559><c> back</c><00:27:44.799><c> this</c><00:27:45.039><c> probably</c><00:27:45.360><c> then</c><00:27:45.520><c> they'll</c><00:27:45.760><c> be</c>

00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
go back this probably then they'll be
 

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:47.590 align:start position:0%
go back this probably then they'll be
able<00:27:46.159><c> to</c><00:27:46.399><c> stretch</c><00:27:46.799><c> out</c><00:27:46.960><c> the</c><00:27:47.120><c> sentence</c><00:27:47.520><c> a</c>

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
able to stretch out the sentence a
 

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:47.990 align:start position:0%
able to stretch out the sentence a
little<00:27:47.760><c> bit</c>

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
little bit
 

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.789 align:start position:0%
little bit
more<00:27:48.960><c> but</c><00:27:49.120><c> they</c><00:27:49.279><c> have</c><00:27:49.440><c> to</c><00:27:49.600><c> get</c><00:27:49.760><c> a</c><00:27:49.919><c> kick</c><00:27:50.080><c> start</c>

00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
more but they have to get a kick start
 

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:51.269 align:start position:0%
more but they have to get a kick start
yeah

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:53.190 align:start position:0%
yeah
so<00:27:51.440><c> something</c><00:27:51.760><c> like</c><00:27:52.159><c> there</c><00:27:52.399><c> are</c><00:27:52.799><c> there</c><00:27:52.960><c> are</c>

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
so something like there are there are
 

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.310 align:start position:0%
so something like there are there are
two<00:27:53.360><c> main</c><00:27:53.679><c> reasons</c>

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
two main reasons
 

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.990 align:start position:0%
two main reasons
for<00:27:55.919><c> um</c><00:27:56.320><c> the</c><00:27:56.480><c> obesity</c><00:27:57.039><c> crisis</c><00:27:57.520><c> or</c><00:27:57.679><c> something</c>

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
for um the obesity crisis or something
 

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.950 align:start position:0%
for um the obesity crisis or something
like<00:27:58.240><c> that</c><00:27:58.480><c> it's</c><00:27:58.640><c> a</c>

00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
like that it's a
 

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.310 align:start position:0%
like that it's a
it's<00:27:59.120><c> a</c><00:27:59.200><c> nice</c><00:27:59.440><c> simple</c><00:27:59.679><c> way</c><00:27:59.840><c> to</c><00:28:00.000><c> introduce</c>

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's a nice simple way to introduce
 

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.549 align:start position:0%
it's a nice simple way to introduce
exactly<00:28:01.440><c> simple</c><00:28:01.760><c> sentence</c>

00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
exactly simple sentence
 

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:05.830 align:start position:0%
exactly simple sentence
just<00:28:02.799><c> to</c><00:28:02.960><c> kick</c><00:28:03.200><c> start</c>

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
and<00:28:06.000><c> then</c><00:28:06.399><c> they</c><00:28:07.039><c> they'll</c><00:28:07.200><c> be</c><00:28:07.360><c> able</c><00:28:07.600><c> to</c><00:28:07.679><c> develop</c>

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
and then they they'll be able to develop
 

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.430 align:start position:0%
and then they they'll be able to develop
that<00:28:08.320><c> paragraph</c>

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
that paragraph
 

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.190 align:start position:0%
that paragraph

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
and another thing is that paragraphs
 

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.149 align:start position:0%
and another thing is that paragraphs
don't<00:28:11.600><c> focus</c><00:28:12.000><c> on</c><00:28:12.159><c> a</c><00:28:12.320><c> single</c><00:28:12.720><c> idea</c>

00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't focus on a single idea
 

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.310 align:start position:0%
don't focus on a single idea
sometimes<00:28:14.640><c> they</c><00:28:14.880><c> try</c><00:28:15.039><c> to</c><00:28:15.360><c> you</c><00:28:15.440><c> know</c><00:28:15.600><c> put</c><00:28:15.840><c> in</c><00:28:16.080><c> so</c>

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes they try to you know put in so
 

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.510 align:start position:0%
sometimes they try to you know put in so
many<00:28:16.559><c> ideas</c><00:28:17.120><c> and</c>

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
many ideas and
 

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.789 align:start position:0%
many ideas and
it<00:28:18.720><c> that</c><00:28:19.200><c> becomes</c><00:28:19.600><c> confusing</c>

00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
it that becomes confusing
 

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:24.230 align:start position:0%
it that becomes confusing
and<00:28:21.039><c> disastrous</c><00:28:21.760><c> once</c><00:28:22.080><c> again</c>

think<00:28:26.960><c> um</c>

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
think um
 

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.470 align:start position:0%
think um
the<00:28:28.640><c> the</c><00:28:28.799><c> use</c><00:28:29.039><c> of</c><00:28:29.200><c> linking</c><00:28:29.600><c> words</c><00:28:30.000><c> is</c><00:28:30.159><c> also</c>

in<00:28:50.240><c> the</c><00:28:50.399><c> criteria</c>

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.110 align:start position:0%
in the criteria
and<00:28:51.679><c> so</c><00:28:51.840><c> the</c><00:28:52.080><c> students</c><00:28:52.399><c> need</c><00:28:52.559><c> to</c><00:28:52.720><c> be</c><00:28:52.799><c> aware</c><00:28:53.039><c> of</c>

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
and so the students need to be aware of
 

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.470 align:start position:0%

we work on in a lot of our classes and

it makes a huge difference i think the

it makes a huge difference i think the

students can

immediately see how much better their

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
work is when the linking is

is an

is an

00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
issue also they're not aware because
 

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.350 align:start position:0%
issue also they're not aware because
many<00:29:26.320><c> of</c><00:29:26.399><c> them</c><00:29:26.640><c> come</c><00:29:26.880><c> from</c>

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
many of them come from
 

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.470 align:start position:0%
many of them come from
the<00:29:27.520><c> mother</c><00:29:27.919><c> tongue</c><00:29:29.039><c> uh</c><00:29:29.440><c> the</c><00:29:29.760><c> verbs</c><00:29:30.159><c> that</c>

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
the mother tongue uh the verbs that
 

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
the mother tongue uh the verbs that
the<00:29:30.720><c> verb</c><00:29:31.039><c> itself</c><00:29:31.760><c> already</c><00:29:32.240><c> holds</c><00:29:33.360><c> the</c>

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
the verb itself already holds the
 

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.630 align:start position:0%
the verb itself already holds the
subject

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
subject
 

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.350 align:start position:0%
subject
so<00:29:35.120><c> they</c><00:29:35.360><c> really</c><00:29:35.600><c> don't</c><00:29:35.919><c> need</c><00:29:36.320><c> a</c><00:29:36.720><c> subject</c><00:29:37.200><c> in</c>

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
so they really don't need a subject in
 

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.230 align:start position:0%
so they really don't need a subject in
the<00:29:37.440><c> sentence</c>

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
the sentence
 

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.870 align:start position:0%
the sentence
so<00:29:38.559><c> the</c><00:29:39.200><c> the</c><00:29:39.360><c> use</c><00:29:39.679><c> of</c><00:29:39.840><c> pronouns</c><00:29:40.320><c> for</c><00:29:40.559><c> them</c><00:29:40.799><c> is</c>

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
so the the use of pronouns for them is
 

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.750 align:start position:0%
so the the use of pronouns for them is
kind<00:29:41.120><c> of</c><00:29:41.279><c> like</c>

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
kind of like
 

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.269 align:start position:0%
kind of like
it's<00:29:41.840><c> not</c><00:29:42.080><c> very</c><00:29:42.320><c> clear</c><00:29:43.279><c> and</c><00:29:44.000><c> this</c><00:29:44.720><c> this</c><00:29:44.960><c> is</c><00:29:45.120><c> a</c>

00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
it's not very clear and this this is a
 

00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:46.870 align:start position:0%
it's not very clear and this this is a
very<00:29:45.600><c> important</c><00:29:46.080><c> element</c>

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
very important element
 

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.590 align:start position:0%

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
for coherence and cohesion is the use of
 

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.549 align:start position:0%
for coherence and cohesion is the use of

with a lot of practice yeah that's
 

00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:13.909 align:start position:0%
with a lot of practice yeah that's

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
that need to be closed as well so um
 

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.710 align:start position:0%
that need to be closed as well so um
yeah<00:32:56.960><c> i</c><00:32:57.039><c> guess</c><00:32:57.279><c> the</c><00:32:57.440><c> keys</c><00:32:57.840><c> to</c><00:32:58.000><c> scoring</c><00:32:58.399><c> well</c>

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess the keys to scoring well
 

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.389 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess the keys to scoring well
are<00:32:58.799><c> demonstrating</c><00:32:59.440><c> range</c><00:32:59.919><c> and</c><00:33:00.080><c> also</c>

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
well firstly they have to avoid
 

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.310 align:start position:0%
well firstly they have to avoid
repetition<00:33:13.039><c> that's</c><00:33:13.440><c> definitely</c><00:33:14.000><c> because</c>

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
repetition that's definitely because
 

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.310 align:start position:0%
repetition that's definitely because
then<00:33:14.559><c> it</c><00:33:14.640><c> goes</c><00:33:14.880><c> into</c><00:33:15.120><c> the</c><00:33:15.279><c> range</c>

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
then it goes into the range
 

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.549 align:start position:0%
then it goes into the range
but<00:33:16.720><c> they</c><00:33:16.960><c> also</c><00:33:17.279><c> have</c><00:33:17.440><c> to</c><00:33:17.519><c> understand</c><00:33:18.159><c> what</c>

00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
but they also have to understand what
 

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.230 align:start position:0%
but they also have to understand what

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
really have to focus on this
 

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.150 align:start position:0%
really have to focus on this

and what about range which is the other

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.589 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:39:26.640><c> regarding</c><00:39:27.119><c> grammar</c><00:39:27.520><c> right</c>

00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
so regarding grammar right
 

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:31.910 align:start position:0%
so regarding grammar right
so<00:39:29.839><c> they</c><00:39:30.400><c> that's</c><00:39:30.800><c> another</c><00:39:31.280><c> issue</c><00:39:31.520><c> it's</c><00:39:31.680><c> about</c>

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
so they that's another issue it's about
 

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.510 align:start position:0%
so they that's another issue it's about
the<00:39:32.079><c> sentence</c><00:39:32.560><c> structures</c><00:39:33.119><c> then</c>

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
the sentence structures then
 

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.550 align:start position:0%
the sentence structures then
they<00:39:33.760><c> have</c><00:39:33.920><c> to</c><00:39:34.160><c> really</c><00:39:34.720><c> put</c><00:39:34.960><c> in</c><00:39:35.599><c> the</c>

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
they have to really put in the

they have to really put in the

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.550 align:start position:0%

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%

from training through injury and illness
 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
from training through injury and illness
um<00:03:38.640><c> the</c><00:03:38.799><c> greater</c><00:03:39.760><c> that</c><00:03:40.000><c> they're</c><00:03:40.480><c> likely</c><00:03:40.799><c> to</c><00:03:40.959><c> be</c>

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
um the greater that they're likely to be
 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.229 align:start position:0%
um the greater that they're likely to be
able<00:03:41.200><c> to</c><00:03:41.360><c> produce</c>

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
able to produce
 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.430 align:start position:0%
able to produce
their<00:03:43.200><c> uh</c><00:03:43.920><c> best</c><00:03:44.159><c> performances</c><00:03:45.200><c> when</c><00:03:45.360><c> it</c>

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
their uh best performances when it
 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
their uh best performances when it
really<00:03:45.760><c> mounts</c>

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
really mounts
 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.630 align:start position:0%
really mounts
and<00:03:47.280><c> um</c><00:03:47.519><c> yeah</c><00:03:47.680><c> so</c><00:03:47.760><c> it's</c><00:03:47.840><c> sort</c><00:03:48.000><c> of</c><00:03:48.319><c> in</c><00:03:48.400><c> that</c>

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
and um yeah so it's sort of in that
 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.350 align:start position:0%
and um yeah so it's sort of in that
space<00:03:48.959><c> that</c><00:03:49.040><c> we're</c>

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
body is really important we know that
 

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:14.710 align:start position:0%
body is really important we know that
really<00:15:12.560><c> great</c><00:15:12.880><c> way</c><00:15:13.120><c> for</c><00:15:13.360><c> us</c><00:15:13.760><c> to</c>

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
really great way for us to
 

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.710 align:start position:0%
really great way for us to
reduce<00:15:15.199><c> stress</c><00:15:16.880><c> when</c><00:15:17.120><c> we</c><00:15:17.519><c> when</c><00:15:17.680><c> we</c><00:15:17.920><c> move</c>

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
reduce stress when we when we move
 

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.670 align:start position:0%
reduce stress when we when we move
it<00:15:18.800><c> helps</c><00:15:19.040><c> our</c><00:15:19.199><c> body</c><00:15:19.600><c> to</c><00:15:19.920><c> metabolize</c><00:15:21.279><c> cortisol</c>

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
it helps our body to metabolize cortisol
 

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
it helps our body to metabolize cortisol
which<00:15:21.839><c> is</c><00:15:21.920><c> our</c><00:15:22.079><c> stress</c><00:15:22.399><c> hormone</c>

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
which is our stress hormone
 

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.150 align:start position:0%
which is our stress hormone
so<00:15:23.839><c> that's</c><00:15:24.079><c> really</c><00:15:24.320><c> important</c><00:15:24.800><c> and</c><00:15:24.959><c> then</c><00:15:25.120><c> also</c>

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
so that's really important and then also
 

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.189 align:start position:0%
so that's really important and then also
we<00:15:26.320><c> know</c><00:15:26.560><c> that</c>

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
we know that
 

00:15:27.199 --> 00:15:29.749 align:start position:0%
we know that
movement<00:15:27.600><c> is</c><00:15:27.760><c> really</c><00:15:28.000><c> important</c><00:15:28.639><c> for</c>

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
movement is really important for
 

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:30.470 align:start position:0%
movement is really important for
cognition

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
cognition
 

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.230 align:start position:0%
cognition
okay<00:15:30.720><c> it</c><00:15:30.800><c> helps</c><00:15:31.040><c> with</c><00:15:31.360><c> learning</c><00:15:31.839><c> and</c><00:15:32.000><c> with</c>

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay it helps with learning and with
 

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.590 align:start position:0%
okay it helps with learning and with
memory

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
memory
 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.069 align:start position:0%

so<00:15:33.839><c> definitely</c><00:15:34.480><c> doing</c><00:15:34.800><c> something</c><00:15:35.680><c> every</c><00:15:35.920><c> day</c>

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
so definitely doing something every day
 

00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:36.949 align:start position:0%

which<00:17:24.240><c> is</c><00:17:24.400><c> really</c>

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
which is really
 

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
which is really
important<00:17:25.280><c> so</c><00:17:25.439><c> that's</c><00:17:26.000><c> that's</c><00:17:26.319><c> one</c><00:17:26.559><c> aspect</c>

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
important so that's that's one aspect
 

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.950 align:start position:0%
important so that's that's one aspect
the<00:17:27.760><c> other</c><00:17:27.919><c> thing</c><00:17:28.079><c> which</c><00:17:28.240><c> i</c><00:17:28.319><c> think</c><00:17:28.480><c> is</c><00:17:28.640><c> also</c>

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing which i think is also
 

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.789 align:start position:0%
the other thing which i think is also
important<00:17:29.360><c> to</c><00:17:29.520><c> acknowledge</c>

00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
important to acknowledge
 

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:33.830 align:start position:0%
important to acknowledge
is<00:17:31.039><c> that</c><00:17:31.679><c> exams</c><00:17:32.960><c> are</c><00:17:33.200><c> difficult</c>

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
is that exams are difficult
 

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.669 align:start position:0%
is that exams are difficult
and<00:17:33.919><c> they</c><00:17:34.240><c> are</c><00:17:34.880><c> stress</c><00:17:35.440><c> provoking</c><00:17:36.720><c> situations</c>

00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
and they are stress provoking situations
 

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:39.190 align:start position:0%
and they are stress provoking situations
and<00:17:37.760><c> they're</c><00:17:38.000><c> designed</c><00:17:38.559><c> in</c><00:17:38.640><c> many</c><00:17:38.880><c> ways</c>

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
and they're designed in many ways
 

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.029 align:start position:0%
and they're designed in many ways
intentionally<00:17:39.840><c> to</c><00:17:40.000><c> do</c><00:17:40.240><c> that</c>

00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
intentionally to do that
 

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:44.549 align:start position:0%
intentionally to do that
and<00:17:41.280><c> so</c><00:17:41.919><c> part</c><00:17:42.160><c> of</c><00:17:42.320><c> it</c><00:17:42.480><c> is</c><00:17:42.640><c> also</c><00:17:43.840><c> i</c><00:17:44.000><c> guess</c>

00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
and so part of it is also i guess
 

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:47.590 align:start position:0%
and so part of it is also i guess
a<00:17:44.720><c> willingness</c><00:17:45.360><c> to</c><00:17:45.600><c> tolerate</c><00:17:46.559><c> discomfort</c>

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
a willingness to tolerate discomfort

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:38.710 align:start position:0%
about that yeah so
again<00:18:35.919><c> we</c><00:18:36.080><c> don't</c><00:18:36.320><c> want</c><00:18:36.559><c> to</c><00:18:37.360><c> change</c><00:18:37.760><c> anything</c><00:18:38.559><c> a</c>

again we don't want to change anything a
 

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
again we don't want to change anything a
day<00:18:38.960><c> or</c><00:18:39.120><c> two</c><00:18:39.280><c> days</c><00:18:39.520><c> before</c><00:18:40.080><c> so</c>

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
day or two days before so
 

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.710 align:start position:0%
day or two days before so
we<00:18:41.039><c> want</c><00:18:41.200><c> to</c><00:18:41.360><c> keep</c><00:18:41.520><c> doing</c><00:18:41.840><c> our</c><00:18:41.919><c> same</c><00:18:42.160><c> routine</c>

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
we want to keep doing our same routine
 

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.710 align:start position:0%
we want to keep doing our same routine
so<00:18:43.760><c> hopefully</c>

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
so hopefully
 

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.029 align:start position:0%
so hopefully
you<00:18:44.799><c> know</c><00:18:44.960><c> everyone</c><00:18:45.360><c> has</c><00:18:45.600><c> a</c><00:18:46.480><c> good</c><00:18:46.720><c> sleep</c>

00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
you know everyone has a good sleep
 

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.789 align:start position:0%
you know everyone has a good sleep
routine<00:18:47.520><c> where</c><00:18:47.679><c> they</c><00:18:47.840><c> go</c><00:18:48.000><c> to</c><00:18:48.080><c> bed</c><00:18:48.320><c> at</c><00:18:48.400><c> the</c><00:18:48.480><c> same</c>

00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
routine where they go to bed at the same
 

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:49.270 align:start position:0%
routine where they go to bed at the same
time

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
time
 

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.710 align:start position:0%
time
every<00:18:49.440><c> night</c><00:18:49.679><c> and</c><00:18:49.760><c> they</c><00:18:49.919><c> wake</c><00:18:50.240><c> at</c><00:18:50.320><c> the</c><00:18:50.400><c> same</c>

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
every night and they wake at the same
 

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.549 align:start position:0%
every night and they wake at the same
time<00:18:51.440><c> and</c><00:18:51.600><c> if</c><00:18:51.760><c> they're</c><00:18:52.000><c> not</c>

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
time and if they're not
 

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:53.830 align:start position:0%
time and if they're not
it's<00:18:52.720><c> probably</c><00:18:52.880><c> a</c><00:18:52.960><c> good</c><00:18:53.120><c> idea</c><00:18:53.360><c> to</c><00:18:53.440><c> be</c><00:18:53.600><c> doing</c>

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's probably a good idea to be doing
 

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.190 align:start position:0%
it's probably a good idea to be doing
that<00:18:54.000><c> and</c><00:18:54.080><c> particularly</c><00:18:54.720><c> you</c><00:18:54.880><c> know</c><00:18:54.960><c> a</c><00:18:55.039><c> few</c>

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
that and particularly you know a few
 

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
that and particularly you know a few
days<00:18:55.360><c> before</c><00:18:55.600><c> the</c><00:18:55.679><c> exam</c>

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
days before the exam
 

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.549 align:start position:0%
days before the exam
so<00:18:56.160><c> if</c><00:18:56.240><c> you've</c><00:18:56.320><c> got</c><00:18:56.480><c> a</c><00:18:56.559><c> 9</c><00:18:56.799><c> a.m</c><00:18:57.120><c> exam</c><00:18:58.320><c> and</c><00:18:58.480><c> you</c>

00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
so if you've got a 9 a.m exam and you
 

00:18:58.559 --> 00:18:59.990 align:start position:0%
so if you've got a 9 a.m exam and you
know<00:18:58.720><c> you</c><00:18:58.880><c> have</c><00:18:58.960><c> to</c><00:18:59.120><c> be</c><00:18:59.280><c> up</c>

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
know you have to be up
 

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.310 align:start position:0%
know you have to be up
at<00:19:00.640><c> 6</c><00:19:00.880><c> 30</c><00:19:01.120><c> in</c><00:19:01.280><c> the</c><00:19:01.360><c> morning</c><00:19:01.760><c> so</c><00:19:01.919><c> that</c><00:19:02.080><c> you</c><00:19:02.160><c> can</c>

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
at 6 30 in the morning so that you can
 

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.909 align:start position:0%
at 6 30 in the morning so that you can
have<00:19:02.480><c> something</c><00:19:02.720><c> to</c><00:19:02.880><c> eat</c><00:19:03.200><c> and</c><00:19:03.280><c> you</c><00:19:03.440><c> can</c><00:19:03.600><c> get</c><00:19:03.760><c> to</c>

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
have something to eat and you can get to
 

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:05.029 align:start position:0%
have something to eat and you can get to
the<00:19:04.080><c> exam</c>

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
the exam
 

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:07.909 align:start position:0%
the exam
then<00:19:05.600><c> practice</c><00:19:06.160><c> getting</c><00:19:06.559><c> up</c><00:19:06.880><c> at</c><00:19:07.039><c> 6</c><00:19:07.280><c> 30</c><00:19:07.840><c> you</c>

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
then practice getting up at 6 30 you
 

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
then practice getting up at 6 30 you
know<00:19:08.160><c> a</c><00:19:08.240><c> week</c><00:19:08.480><c> before</c><00:19:08.799><c> the</c><00:19:08.960><c> longer</c><00:19:09.280><c> the</c><00:19:09.360><c> better</c>

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
know a week before the longer the better
 

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.549 align:start position:0%
know a week before the longer the better
so<00:19:09.760><c> that</c><00:19:09.840><c> you're</c><00:19:10.000><c> just</c>

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
so that you're just
 

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:13.750 align:start position:0%
so that you're just
consistently<00:19:11.760><c> waking</c><00:19:12.160><c> at</c><00:19:12.240><c> that</c><00:19:12.559><c> time</c><00:19:13.120><c> and</c>

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
consistently waking at that time and
 

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
consistently waking at that time and
weekends<00:19:14.799><c> and</c><00:19:15.200><c> and</c><00:19:15.360><c> with</c><00:19:15.520><c> that</c><00:19:15.760><c> then</c><00:19:15.919><c> you</c><00:19:16.080><c> also</c>

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
weekends and and with that then you also
 

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.590 align:start position:0%
weekends and and with that then you also
want<00:19:16.480><c> to</c><00:19:16.559><c> try</c><00:19:16.799><c> and</c><00:19:16.960><c> set</c>

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
want to try and set
 

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.669 align:start position:0%
want to try and set
a<00:19:17.760><c> bedtime</c><00:19:18.240><c> that's</c><00:19:18.480><c> the</c><00:19:18.640><c> same</c><00:19:18.960><c> so</c><00:19:19.120><c> it</c><00:19:19.200><c> might</c><00:19:19.440><c> be</c>

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
a bedtime that's the same so it might be
 

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:22.070 align:start position:0%
a bedtime that's the same so it might be
you<00:19:19.760><c> know</c><00:19:20.000><c> 10</c><00:19:20.320><c> 10</c><00:19:20.480><c> p.m</c><00:19:20.799><c> or</c><00:19:20.960><c> whatever</c>

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
humans don't concentrate for that for
 

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.350 align:start position:0%
humans don't concentrate for that for
that<00:32:40.240><c> length</c><00:32:40.480><c> of</c><00:32:40.640><c> time</c>

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
that length of time
 

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.990 align:start position:0%
that length of time
so<00:32:42.240><c> what</c><00:32:42.480><c> helps</c><00:32:42.880><c> i</c><00:32:42.960><c> think</c><00:32:43.120><c> is</c><00:32:43.279><c> to</c><00:32:43.440><c> just</c><00:32:43.679><c> break</c>

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
so what helps i think is to just break
 

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
so what helps i think is to just break
it<00:32:44.240><c> down</c>

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
it down
 

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.269 align:start position:0%
it down
into<00:32:45.440><c> like</c><00:32:45.600><c> smaller</c><00:32:46.080><c> chunks</c><00:32:46.640><c> so</c><00:32:46.799><c> you</c><00:32:46.960><c> might</c><00:32:47.120><c> do</c>

00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
into like smaller chunks so you might do
 

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:49.350 align:start position:0%

important<00:33:55.600><c> so</c><00:33:55.840><c> don't</c><00:33:56.559><c> i</c><00:33:56.720><c> suppose</c>

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
important so don't i suppose
 

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.950 align:start position:0%
important so don't i suppose
my<00:33:57.840><c> advice</c><00:33:58.240><c> would</c><00:33:58.399><c> be</c><00:33:58.960><c> don't</c><00:34:00.399><c> think</c><00:34:00.640><c> that</c><00:34:00.799><c> you</c>

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
my advice would be don't think that you
 

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.710 align:start position:0%
my advice would be don't think that you
have<00:34:01.120><c> to</c><00:34:01.279><c> sit</c><00:34:01.519><c> in</c><00:34:01.600><c> your</c><00:34:01.840><c> seat</c><00:34:02.159><c> for</c><00:34:02.320><c> the</c><00:34:02.399><c> whole</c>

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
have to sit in your seat for the whole
 

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.549 align:start position:0%
have to sit in your seat for the whole
three<00:34:03.039><c> hours</c><00:34:03.440><c> and</c><00:34:03.600><c> do</c><00:34:03.760><c> the</c><00:34:03.840><c> exam</c><00:34:04.159><c> from</c><00:34:04.320><c> start</c>

00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
three hours and do the exam from start
 

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:06.310 align:start position:0%
three hours and do the exam from start
to<00:34:04.640><c> finish</c><00:34:04.960><c> that</c><00:34:05.120><c> we</c><00:34:05.200><c> can</c><00:34:05.360><c> break</c><00:34:05.600><c> it</c><00:34:05.760><c> up</c>

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
to finish that we can break it up
 

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.750 align:start position:0%
to finish that we can break it up
we<00:34:06.480><c> can</c><00:34:06.640><c> break</c><00:34:06.880><c> it</c><00:34:06.960><c> down</c><00:34:07.200><c> and</c><00:34:07.279><c> if</c><00:34:07.360><c> you</c><00:34:07.440><c> do</c><00:34:07.600><c> need</c>

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
we can break it down and if you do need
 

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.669 align:start position:0%
we can break it down and if you do need
to<00:34:07.840><c> get</c><00:34:08.000><c> out</c><00:34:08.159><c> and</c><00:34:08.240><c> come</c><00:34:08.480><c> back</c><00:34:08.720><c> in</c><00:34:09.280><c> that</c><00:34:09.520><c> can</c>

00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
to get out and come back in that can
 

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.550 align:start position:0%
to get out and come back in that can
actually<00:34:09.919><c> be</c><00:34:10.079><c> really</c>

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
actually be really
 

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.950 align:start position:0%
actually be really
really<00:34:10.879><c> valuable</c><00:34:11.440><c> so</c><00:34:12.159><c> that</c><00:34:12.320><c> would</c><00:34:12.480><c> be</c>

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
really valuable so that would be
 

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.790 align:start position:0%
really valuable so that would be
something<00:34:13.280><c> i</c><00:34:13.440><c> would</c><00:34:13.599><c> consider</c>

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
something i would consider
 

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.109 align:start position:0%
something i would consider
um<00:34:15.119><c> but</c><00:34:15.280><c> again</c><00:34:15.520><c> using</c><00:34:15.919><c> our</c><00:34:16.480><c> you</c><00:34:16.639><c> know</c><00:34:16.800><c> using</c>

00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
um but again using our you know using
 

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:18.470 align:start position:0%
um but again using our you know using
our<00:34:17.280><c> breathing</c>

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
our breathing
 

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.790 align:start position:0%
our breathing
is<00:34:18.639><c> also</c><00:34:18.960><c> really</c><00:34:19.200><c> important</c><00:34:19.679><c> during</c><00:34:20.560><c> during</c>

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
is also really important during during
 

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.230 align:start position:0%
is also really important during during
that<00:34:21.040><c> exam</c><00:34:21.440><c> as</c><00:34:21.599><c> well</c>

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
that exam as well
 

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.149 align:start position:0%
that exam as well
um<00:34:22.639><c> just</c><00:34:22.800><c> being</c><00:34:22.960><c> able</c><00:34:23.040><c> to</c><00:34:23.200><c> take</c><00:34:23.440><c> those</c><00:34:23.839><c> those</c>

00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
um just being able to take those those
 

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:26.470 align:start position:0%
um just being able to take those those
calming<00:34:24.720><c> centering</c><00:34:25.200><c> breaths</c><00:34:25.599><c> just</c><00:34:25.760><c> to</c><00:34:25.919><c> reset</c>

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
calming centering breaths just to reset
 

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:26.950 align:start position:0%
calming centering breaths just to reset
and

00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
and
 

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.349 align:start position:0%
and
yeah<00:34:27.200><c> i</c><00:34:27.280><c> think</c><00:34:27.520><c> breaking</c><00:34:27.919><c> it</c><00:34:28.079><c> down</c><00:34:29.040><c> into</c>

00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i think breaking it down into
 

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.190 align:start position:0%
yeah i think breaking it down into
smaller<00:34:29.839><c> sections</c>

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
smaller sections
 

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.149 align:start position:0%
smaller sections
one<00:34:31.839><c> helps</c><00:34:32.320><c> to</c><00:34:32.800><c> reduce</c><00:34:33.280><c> the</c><00:34:33.440><c> complexity</c><00:34:34.079><c> of</c>

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
one helps to reduce the complexity of
 

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.750 align:start position:0%
one helps to reduce the complexity of

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
the task which makes it
 

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.950 align:start position:0%
the task which makes it
a<00:34:35.839><c> little</c><00:34:36.079><c> bit</c><00:34:36.480><c> easier</c><00:34:37.280><c> for</c><00:34:37.440><c> us</c><00:34:37.599><c> to</c><00:34:37.760><c> do</c>

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit easier for us to do
 

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.710 align:start position:0%
a little bit easier for us to do

mount kilimanjaro for example and we

mount kilimanjaro for example and we

that's<00:34:47.919><c> really</c><00:34:48.159><c> long</c><00:34:48.399><c> i</c><00:34:48.480><c> don't</c><00:34:48.639><c> think</c><00:34:48.720><c> we</c><00:34:48.879><c> can</c>

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's really long i don't think we can
 

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.069 align:start position:0%
that's really long i don't think we can
do<00:34:49.280><c> it</c>

00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
do it
 

00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:51.909 align:start position:0%
do it
you're<00:34:50.320><c> forgetting</c><00:34:50.720><c> the</c><00:34:50.879><c> fact</c><00:34:51.200><c> that</c><00:34:51.520><c> you</c><00:34:51.760><c> have</c>

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
you're forgetting the fact that you have
 

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:54.389 align:start position:0%
you're forgetting the fact that you have

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
to take individual steps
 

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:57.270 align:start position:0%
to take individual steps
to<00:34:54.560><c> get</c><00:34:54.800><c> to</c><00:34:54.960><c> that</c><00:34:55.200><c> point</c><00:34:56.159><c> and</c><00:34:56.560><c> if</c><00:34:56.800><c> we</c><00:34:56.960><c> start</c>

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
to get to that point and if we start
 

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.990 align:start position:0%
to get to that point and if we start
focusing<00:34:57.680><c> on</c><00:34:57.760><c> those</c><00:34:57.920><c> individual</c><00:34:58.400><c> steps</c>

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
focusing on those individual steps
 

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.270 align:start position:0%

eventually<00:35:00.880><c> we</c><00:35:01.040><c> get</c><00:35:01.200><c> to</c><00:35:01.359><c> the</c><00:35:01.520><c> top</c><00:35:01.920><c> good</c><00:35:02.079><c> one</c>

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
eventually we get to the top good one
 

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.430 align:start position:0%
eventually we get to the top good one
then<00:35:03.440><c> we</c><00:35:03.599><c> can</c><00:35:03.760><c> apply</c><00:35:04.079><c> that</c><00:35:04.320><c> similar</c><00:35:04.960><c> principle</c>

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
then we can apply that similar principle
 

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.190 align:start position:0%
then we can apply that similar principle
when<00:35:05.599><c> it</c><00:35:05.760><c> comes</c><00:35:05.920><c> to</c><00:35:06.079><c> an</c><00:35:06.240><c> exam</c><00:35:06.560><c> that</c><00:35:06.720><c> sometimes</c>

and what some of the reasons might be
it'll<00:02:36.000><c> also</c><00:02:36.400><c> help</c><00:02:36.720><c> you</c><00:02:37.360><c> prepare</c><00:02:37.840><c> your</c><00:02:38.080><c> answer</c>

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
it'll also help you prepare your answer
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.070 align:start position:0%
it'll also help you prepare your answer
and<00:02:38.879><c> organize</c><00:02:39.519><c> it</c>

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
and organize it
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.910 align:start position:0%
and organize it
better<00:02:40.480><c> if</c><00:02:40.640><c> you</c><00:02:40.879><c> know</c><00:02:41.120><c> exactly</c><00:02:41.599><c> what</c><00:02:41.760><c> the</c>

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
better if you know exactly what the
 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
better if you know exactly what the
reading<00:02:42.239><c> was</c><00:02:42.400><c> about</c>

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
reading was about
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.550 align:start position:0%
reading was about
so<00:02:44.560><c> there's</c><00:02:44.879><c> basically</c><00:02:45.519><c> three</c><00:02:45.920><c> things</c><00:02:46.400><c> that</c>

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
so there's basically three things that
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.550 align:start position:0%
so there's basically three things that
you<00:02:46.800><c> need</c><00:02:46.959><c> to</c><00:02:47.200><c> note</c><00:02:47.519><c> down</c>

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
you need to note down
 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
you need to note down
and<00:02:48.720><c> the</c><00:02:48.879><c> reading</c><00:02:49.280><c> usually</c><00:02:49.840><c> has</c><00:02:50.400><c> the</c><00:02:50.640><c> same</c>

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
and the reading usually has the same
 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.229 align:start position:0%
and the reading usually has the same
structure

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
structure
 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.869 align:start position:0%
structure
so<00:02:52.400><c> this</c><00:02:52.640><c> should</c><00:02:52.879><c> be</c><00:02:53.040><c> pretty</c><00:02:53.440><c> easy</c><00:02:54.000><c> and</c><00:02:54.720><c> you</c>

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
so this should be pretty easy and you
 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.150 align:start position:0%
so this should be pretty easy and you
should<00:02:55.040><c> be</c><00:02:55.280><c> able</c><00:02:55.599><c> to</c>

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
should be able to
 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.070 align:start position:0%
should be able to
figure<00:02:56.480><c> this</c><00:02:56.720><c> out</c><00:02:56.959><c> pretty</c><00:02:57.200><c> quickly</c><00:02:57.680><c> if</c><00:02:57.840><c> you</c>

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
figure this out pretty quickly if you
 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.630 align:start position:0%
figure this out pretty quickly if you
practice<00:02:58.480><c> it</c><00:02:58.640><c> a</c><00:02:58.720><c> few</c><00:02:58.959><c> times</c>

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
practice it a few times
 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.350 align:start position:0%
practice it a few times
so<00:03:00.800><c> the</c><00:03:00.959><c> reading</c><00:03:01.280><c> will</c><00:03:01.519><c> usually</c><00:03:02.080><c> start</c><00:03:02.480><c> off</c><00:03:03.120><c> by</c>

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
so the reading will usually start off by
 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.990 align:start position:0%
so the reading will usually start off by
announcing

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 align:start position:0%

all<00:04:48.160><c> right</c><00:04:48.320><c> this</c><00:04:48.639><c> might</c><00:04:48.880><c> be</c><00:04:49.040><c> a</c><00:04:49.120><c> little</c>

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
all right this might be a little
 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.189 align:start position:0%
all right this might be a little
confusing<00:04:50.000><c> for</c><00:04:50.240><c> some</c><00:04:50.479><c> of</c><00:04:50.639><c> you</c>

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
confusing for some of you
 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.070 align:start position:0%
confusing for some of you
but<00:04:51.520><c> basically</c><00:04:52.080><c> what</c><00:04:52.240><c> i</c><00:04:52.400><c> have</c><00:04:52.560><c> done</c><00:04:53.120><c> is</c><00:04:53.840><c> not</c>

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
but basically what i have done is not
 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.749 align:start position:0%
but basically what i have done is not
written<00:04:54.400><c> down</c><00:04:54.720><c> full</c><00:04:55.040><c> words</c><00:04:55.919><c> used</c><00:04:56.240><c> a</c><00:04:56.320><c> lot</c><00:04:56.560><c> of</c>

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 align:start position:0%
written down full words used a lot of
 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.670 align:start position:0%
written down full words used a lot of
abbreviations<00:04:57.840><c> and</c><00:04:58.080><c> symbols</c>

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
abbreviations and symbols
 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.990 align:start position:0%
abbreviations and symbols
and<00:05:00.240><c> i've</c><00:05:00.479><c> done</c><00:05:00.639><c> this</c><00:05:00.880><c> to</c><00:05:01.039><c> basically</c><00:05:01.600><c> save</c>

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
and i've done this to basically save
 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.870 align:start position:0%
and i've done this to basically save
time<00:05:02.560><c> because</c><00:05:02.880><c> you</c><00:05:03.039><c> only</c><00:05:03.280><c> have</c><00:05:03.520><c> 50</c><00:05:04.080><c> seconds</c>

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
time because you only have 50 seconds
 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.110 align:start position:0%
time because you only have 50 seconds
in<00:05:04.960><c> which</c><00:05:05.199><c> you</c><00:05:05.360><c> need</c><00:05:05.600><c> to</c><00:05:05.840><c> read</c><00:05:06.240><c> and</c><00:05:06.479><c> understand</c>

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
in which you need to read and understand
 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.790 align:start position:0%
in which you need to read and understand
what's<00:05:07.440><c> written</c><00:05:07.759><c> in</c><00:05:07.840><c> the</c><00:05:08.000><c> passage</c>

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
what's written in the passage
 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.710 align:start position:0%
what's written in the passage
and<00:05:08.960><c> you</c><00:05:09.120><c> also</c><00:05:09.360><c> want</c><00:05:09.520><c> to</c><00:05:09.600><c> take</c><00:05:09.919><c> down</c><00:05:10.479><c> some</c>

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
and you also want to take down some
 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.350 align:start position:0%
and you also want to take down some
important<00:05:11.280><c> notes</c>

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
important notes
 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.270 align:start position:0%
important notes
so<00:05:13.600><c> this</c><00:05:13.759><c> is</c><00:05:15.120><c> what</c><00:05:15.360><c> my</c><00:05:15.680><c> notes</c><00:05:16.160><c> say</c>

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
so this is what my notes say
 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.830 align:start position:0%
so this is what my notes say
so<00:05:17.440><c> the</c><00:05:17.680><c> issue</c><00:05:18.080><c> or</c><00:05:18.320><c> change</c><00:05:18.720><c> being</c><00:05:18.960><c> announced</c>

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
so the issue or change being announced
 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.749 align:start position:0%
so the issue or change being announced
is<00:05:20.080><c> that</c><00:05:20.400><c> the</c><00:05:20.639><c> university</c><00:05:21.280><c> is</c><00:05:21.360><c> going</c><00:05:21.600><c> to</c>

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
is that the university is going to
 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.550 align:start position:0%
is that the university is going to
restrict<00:05:22.400><c> online</c><00:05:22.880><c> storage</c>

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
restrict online storage
 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.950 align:start position:0%
restrict online storage
so<00:05:24.720><c> the</c><00:05:24.880><c> first</c><00:05:25.199><c> reason</c><00:05:25.600><c> for</c><00:05:25.840><c> it</c><00:05:26.320><c> is</c><00:05:26.560><c> because</c>

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
so the first reason for it is because
 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.230 align:start position:0%
so the first reason for it is because
students<00:05:27.360><c> have</c><00:05:27.520><c> been</c><00:05:27.759><c> sharing</c>

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
students have been sharing
 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.670 align:start position:0%
students have been sharing

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
audio and video files and the storage
 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.710 align:start position:0%
audio and video files and the storage
space<00:05:32.080><c> was</c>

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
space was
 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.870 align:start position:0%
space was
actually<00:05:33.199><c> meant</c><00:05:33.759><c> only</c><00:05:34.080><c> for</c><00:05:34.240><c> academic</c>

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
actually meant only for academic
 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.550 align:start position:0%
actually meant only for academic
documents

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
documents
 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.710 align:start position:0%
documents
and<00:05:36.720><c> the</c><00:05:36.880><c> second</c><00:05:37.280><c> reason</c><00:05:37.919><c> is</c><00:05:38.160><c> because</c><00:05:38.560><c> the</c>

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
and the second reason is because the
 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
and the second reason is because the
constant<00:05:39.280><c> uploading</c><00:05:39.919><c> and</c><00:05:40.080><c> downloading</c>

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
constant uploading and downloading
 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.469 align:start position:0%
constant uploading and downloading
um<00:05:41.759><c> has</c><00:05:42.880><c> sort</c><00:05:43.120><c> of</c><00:05:43.280><c> made</c><00:05:43.520><c> the</c><00:05:43.600><c> internet</c><00:05:44.080><c> speed</c>

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
um has sort of made the internet speed
 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.830 align:start position:0%
um has sort of made the internet speed
quite<00:05:44.720><c> slow</c><00:05:46.479><c> and</c><00:05:46.639><c> this</c><00:05:46.800><c> is</c><00:05:46.960><c> basically</c><00:05:47.440><c> what</c><00:05:47.680><c> my</c>

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
quite slow and this is basically what my
 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.110 align:start position:0%
quite slow and this is basically what my
notes<00:05:48.240><c> tell</c><00:05:48.479><c> me</c>

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
notes tell me
 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.430 align:start position:0%
notes tell me
so<00:05:49.280><c> when</c><00:05:49.520><c> i</c><00:05:49.680><c> look</c><00:05:49.919><c> at</c><00:05:50.000><c> my</c><00:05:50.240><c> notes</c><00:05:50.720><c> i</c><00:05:50.960><c> understand</c>

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
so when i look at my notes i understand
 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.749 align:start position:0%
so when i look at my notes i understand
all<00:05:51.600><c> of</c><00:05:51.759><c> these</c><00:05:52.080><c> things</c>

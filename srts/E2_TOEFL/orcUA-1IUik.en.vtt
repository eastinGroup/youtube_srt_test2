you were to
 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
you were to
estimate<00:00:45.200><c> which</c><00:00:45.440><c> is</c><00:00:45.600><c> probably</c><00:00:46.079><c> not</c><00:00:46.239><c> a</c><00:00:46.320><c> good</c>

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
estimate which is probably not a good
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.709 align:start position:0%
estimate which is probably not a good
idea<00:00:47.039><c> what's</c><00:00:47.280><c> your</c><00:00:47.440><c> current</c><00:00:47.680><c> score</c><00:00:48.079><c> because</c>

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
if you're below the score you need then
 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.830 align:start position:0%
if you're below the score you need then
and<00:00:51.920><c> you</c><00:00:52.000><c> have</c><00:00:52.160><c> enough</c><00:00:52.559><c> time</c><00:00:52.879><c> for</c><00:00:53.039><c> preparation</c>

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
and you have enough time for preparation
 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.189 align:start position:0%
and you have enough time for preparation
then<00:00:54.000><c> that's</c><00:00:54.239><c> a</c><00:00:54.320><c> good</c><00:00:54.559><c> thing</c><00:00:54.719><c> but</c><00:00:54.879><c> if</c><00:00:55.039><c> you're</c>

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
then that's a good thing but if you're
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 align:start position:0%
then that's a good thing but if you're
running<00:00:55.520><c> out</c><00:00:55.600><c> of</c><00:00:55.680><c> time</c><00:00:56.079><c> etc</c><00:00:56.640><c> you</c><00:00:56.719><c> need</c><00:00:56.879><c> to</c><00:00:56.960><c> be</c><00:00:57.039><c> a</c>

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
have a small vocabulary you're going to
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.270 align:start position:0%
have a small vocabulary you're going to

okay and toefl uses academic vocabulary
so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.270 align:start position:0%

said for example let's say let's say I'm
sitting<00:01:06.030><c> in</c><00:01:06.150><c> your</c><00:01:06.270><c> house</c><00:01:06.570><c> with</c><00:01:06.900><c> you</c><00:01:07.080><c> and</c><00:01:07.320><c> I</c><00:01:07.380><c> say</c>

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
sitting in your house with you and I say
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
sitting in your house with you and I say
oh<00:01:07.850><c> it's</c><00:01:08.850><c> cold</c><00:01:09.350><c> because</c><00:01:10.350><c> the</c><00:01:10.619><c> window</c><00:01:10.979><c> is</c><00:01:11.100><c> open</c>

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 align:start position:0%
oh it's cold because the window is open
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.630 align:start position:0%
oh it's cold because the window is open
so<00:01:12.030><c> what's</c><00:01:12.210><c> the</c><00:01:12.330><c> inference</c><00:01:13.080><c> here</c><00:01:13.500><c> I</c><00:01:13.740><c> want</c><00:01:14.520><c> you</c>

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
so what's the inference here I want you
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 align:start position:0%
so what's the inference here I want you
to<00:01:14.729><c> close</c><00:01:15.030><c> the</c><00:01:15.299><c> window</c><00:01:15.659><c> but</c><00:01:16.049><c> instead</c><00:01:16.320><c> of</c>

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
to close the window but instead of
 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
to close the window but instead of
explicitly<00:01:17.430><c> saying</c><00:01:17.850><c> to</c><00:01:18.119><c> you</c><00:01:18.240><c> hey</c><00:01:18.659><c> close</c><00:01:19.200><c> the</c>

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 align:start position:0%
explicitly saying to you hey close the
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.179 align:start position:0%
explicitly saying to you hey close the
window<00:01:19.710><c> I</c><00:01:19.979><c> sort</c><00:01:20.640><c> of</c><00:01:20.670><c> say</c><00:01:20.909><c> something</c><00:01:21.509><c> that</c>

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 align:start position:0%
window I sort of say something that
 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.370 align:start position:0%
window I sort of say something that
refers<00:01:23.189><c> to</c><00:01:23.670><c> the</c><00:01:24.090><c> window</c><00:01:24.420><c> being</c><00:01:24.600><c> open</c><00:01:25.080><c> and</c><00:01:25.229><c> it's</c>

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
refers to the window being open and it's
 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
refers to the window being open and it's
cold<00:01:25.710><c> and</c><00:01:26.130><c> so</c><00:01:26.369><c> you</c><00:01:26.430><c> sort</c><00:01:26.759><c> of</c><00:01:26.820><c> think</c><00:01:27.060><c> okay</c><00:01:27.450><c> I'm</c>

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 align:start position:0%
cold and so you sort of think okay I'm
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.929 align:start position:0%
cold and so you sort of think okay I'm
gonna<00:01:28.140><c> close</c><00:01:28.439><c> the</c><00:01:28.650><c> window</c><00:01:28.950><c> because</c><00:01:29.310><c> Jay</c><00:01:29.670><c> must</c>

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 align:start position:0%
gonna close the window because Jay must
 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.620 align:start position:0%
gonna close the window because Jay must
be<00:01:30.090><c> cold</c>

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 align:start position:0%
be cold
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start position:0%
be cold
that's<00:01:31.350><c> an</c><00:01:31.590><c> inference</c><00:01:32.250><c> you</c><00:01:32.549><c> have</c><00:01:32.759><c> inferred</c>

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
that's an inference you have inferred

so here's the question again and let me
 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.430 align:start position:0%
so here's the question again and let me
step<00:05:24.560><c> you</c><00:05:24.800><c> through</c>

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%

my plan so for the intro i've got my
 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
my plan so for the intro i've got my

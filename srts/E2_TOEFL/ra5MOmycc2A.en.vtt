just<00:04:18.790><c> gonna</c><00:04:18.940><c> say</c><00:04:19.180><c> yes</c><00:04:19.480><c> great</c><00:04:20.170><c> idea</c>

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 align:start position:0%
just gonna say yes great idea
 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.370 align:start position:0%
just gonna say yes great idea
the<00:04:21.130><c> main</c><00:04:21.370><c> reason</c><00:04:22.030><c> being</c><00:04:22.240><c> that</c><00:04:22.450><c> you</c><00:04:22.930><c> will</c><00:04:23.200><c> get</c>

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 align:start position:0%
the main reason being that you will get
 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
the main reason being that you will get
a<00:04:23.410><c> longer</c><00:04:23.740><c> weekend</c><00:04:24.430><c> so</c><00:04:25.120><c> instead</c><00:04:25.420><c> of</c><00:04:25.480><c> having</c><00:04:25.660><c> a</c>

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 align:start position:0%
a longer weekend so instead of having a
 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
a longer weekend so instead of having a
two-day<00:04:26.320><c> weekend</c><00:04:26.830><c> you'll</c><00:04:27.340><c> have</c><00:04:27.580><c> a</c><00:04:27.790><c> three-day</c>

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 align:start position:0%
two-day weekend you'll have a three-day
 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
two-day weekend you'll have a three-day
weekend<00:04:29.110><c> which</c><00:04:29.650><c> is</c><00:04:29.680><c> fabulous</c><00:04:30.100><c> of</c><00:04:30.520><c> course</c><00:04:31.090><c> the</c>

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 align:start position:0%
weekend which is fabulous of course the
 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
weekend which is fabulous of course the
downside<00:04:31.480><c> will</c><00:04:32.050><c> be</c><00:04:32.200><c> that</c><00:04:32.440><c> working</c><00:04:33.160><c> ten</c><00:04:33.430><c> hours</c>

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 align:start position:0%
downside will be that working ten hours
 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
downside will be that working ten hours
each<00:04:33.910><c> day</c><00:04:34.150><c> will</c><00:04:34.330><c> be</c><00:04:34.510><c> more</c><00:04:34.750><c> difficult</c><00:04:34.990><c> than</c>

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 align:start position:0%
each day will be more difficult than
 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
each day will be more difficult than
working<00:04:35.830><c> eight</c><00:04:36.040><c> hours</c><00:04:36.100><c> each</c><00:04:36.730><c> day</c><00:04:36.780><c> so</c><00:04:37.780><c> that's</c>

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 align:start position:0%
working eight hours each day so that's
 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
working eight hours each day so that's
what<00:04:38.530><c> you'll</c><00:04:38.680><c> do</c><00:04:38.920><c> now</c><00:04:39.160><c> in</c><00:04:39.430><c> your</c><00:04:39.670><c> presentation</c>

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 align:start position:0%
what you'll do now in your presentation
 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
what you'll do now in your presentation
so<00:04:41.350><c> let's</c><00:04:41.590><c> just</c><00:04:41.920><c> practice</c><00:04:42.100><c> this</c><00:04:42.570><c> I'm</c><00:04:43.570><c> going</c><00:04:43.750><c> to</c>

the fourth thing you can do if you still

differently because of stress and
 

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
differently because of stress and

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:12.430 align:start position:0%
anxiety and it's very difficult to think
 

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.950 align:start position:0%
anxiety and it's very difficult to think
clearly<00:10:14.100><c> I've</c><00:10:15.100><c> done</c><00:10:15.580><c> these</c><00:10:15.790><c> tests</c><00:10:16.240><c> and</c><00:10:16.360><c> I</c><00:10:16.420><c> can</c>

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
clearly I've done these tests and I can
 

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
clearly I've done these tests and I can
tell<00:10:17.140><c> you</c><00:10:17.260><c> from</c><00:10:17.380><c> experience</c><00:10:17.500><c> that</c><00:10:18.220><c> that</c><00:10:18.730><c> is</c>

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:18.850 align:start position:0%
tell you from experience that that is
 

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.690 align:start position:0%
tell you from experience that that is
what<00:10:19.030><c> happens</c><00:10:19.390><c> so</c><00:10:19.630><c> I</c><00:10:20.350><c> was</c><00:10:21.040><c> just</c><00:10:21.070><c> thinking</c><00:10:21.280><c> that</c>

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:21.700 align:start position:0%
what happens so I was just thinking that
 

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
what happens so I was just thinking that
about<00:10:21.820><c> the</c><00:10:22.090><c> optimal</c><00:10:22.570><c> way</c><00:10:22.720><c> to</c><00:10:22.780><c> prepare</c><00:10:23.320><c> for</c>

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:23.530 align:start position:0%
about the optimal way to prepare for
 

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.190 align:start position:0%
about the optimal way to prepare for
this<00:10:23.680><c> I</c><00:10:24.240><c> think</c><00:10:25.240><c> this</c><00:10:25.510><c> is</c><00:10:25.570><c> what</c><00:10:25.810><c> you</c><00:10:25.900><c> should</c><00:10:25.930><c> do</c>

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
this I think this is what you should do
 

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.070 align:start position:0%
this I think this is what you should do
in<00:10:26.320><c> your</c><00:10:26.350><c> preparation</c><00:10:26.980><c> time</c><00:10:27.690><c> really</c><00:10:28.690><c> what</c><00:10:28.960><c> you</c>

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
in your preparation time really what you
 

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
in your preparation time really what you

want to do in this preparation time is
 

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
want to do in this preparation time is
is<00:10:31.090><c> really</c><00:10:31.420><c> just</c><00:10:31.570><c> one</c><00:10:32.020><c> thing</c><00:10:32.410><c> and</c><00:10:32.740><c> that's</c><00:10:33.700><c> just</c>

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:33.850 align:start position:0%
is really just one thing and that's just

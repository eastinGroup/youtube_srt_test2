they were smaller actually at the time
 

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.130 align:start position:0%

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
it can't be done
 

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
it can't be done

CBG CPG cpu consumer packaged goods so I
kept<00:14:55.120><c> thinking</c><00:14:55.600><c> that</c><00:14:56.550><c> you</c><00:14:57.550><c> know</c><00:14:57.700><c> maybe</c><00:14:58.150><c> I</c>

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
kept thinking that you know maybe I
 

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.850 align:start position:0%
kept thinking that you know maybe I
don't<00:14:58.420><c> want</c><00:14:58.540><c> to</c><00:14:58.600><c> be</c><00:14:58.690><c> in</c><00:14:58.779><c> this</c><00:14:58.900><c> industry</c><00:14:59.110><c> and</c>

00:14:59.850 --> 00:14:59.860 align:start position:0%
don't want to be in this industry and
 

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.329 align:start position:0%
don't want to be in this industry and
then<00:15:00.100><c> I</c><00:15:00.130><c> thought</c><00:15:00.490><c> well</c><00:15:01.270><c> I</c><00:15:01.810><c> think</c><00:15:02.650><c> differently</c>

00:15:03.329 --> 00:15:03.339 align:start position:0%
then I thought well I think differently
 

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
then I thought well I think differently
and<00:15:03.760><c> so</c><00:15:04.180><c> maybe</c><00:15:04.420><c> I'm</c><00:15:04.660><c> the</c><00:15:04.870><c> one</c><00:15:05.020><c> that</c><00:15:05.320><c> actually</c>

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
and so maybe I'm the one that actually
 

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.190 align:start position:0%
and so maybe I'm the one that actually
needs<00:15:05.920><c> to</c><00:15:06.010><c> go</c><00:15:06.250><c> and</c><00:15:06.490><c> and</c><00:15:06.730><c> watch</c><00:15:07.420><c> the</c><00:15:07.720><c> shading</c>

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:08.200 align:start position:0%
needs to go and and watch the shading
 

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.350 align:start position:0%
needs to go and and watch the shading

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
around differently and and do things
 

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.170 align:start position:0%
around differently and and do things
differently<00:15:10.510><c> too</c><00:15:11.170><c> and</c><00:15:11.529><c> so</c><00:15:11.709><c> so</c><00:15:12.279><c> I</c><00:15:12.310><c> you</c><00:15:13.029><c> know</c><00:15:13.150><c> I</c>

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the only reason why i changed is
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.390 align:start position:0%
and the only reason why i changed is
because<00:03:18.959><c> i</c><00:03:19.120><c> started</c><00:03:19.440><c> having</c><00:03:19.760><c> a</c><00:03:19.840><c> goal</c>

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
because i started having a goal
 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.309 align:start position:0%
because i started having a goal
and<00:03:20.560><c> i</c><00:03:20.640><c> was</c><00:03:20.720><c> like</c><00:03:20.959><c> okay</c><00:03:21.760><c> i'm</c><00:03:21.920><c> gonna</c><00:03:22.159><c> work</c>

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.949 align:start position:0%
really hard in all these subjects
so<00:03:24.000><c> that</c><00:03:24.159><c> i</c><00:03:24.239><c> can</c><00:03:24.480><c> study</c><00:03:24.879><c> law</c><00:03:25.680><c> and</c><00:03:26.000><c> i</c><00:03:26.159><c> did</c><00:03:26.400><c> that</c>

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 align:start position:0%
so that i can study law and i did that
 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.270 align:start position:0%
so that i can study law and i did that
but<00:03:27.280><c> before</c><00:03:27.599><c> that</c><00:03:27.840><c> i</c><00:03:28.000><c> literally</c><00:03:28.400><c> had</c><00:03:28.799><c> zero</c>

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
but before that i literally had zero
 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.190 align:start position:0%
but before that i literally had zero

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
goals like no ambition
 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.670 align:start position:0%
goals like no ambition
and<00:03:31.519><c> so</c><00:03:31.680><c> i</c><00:03:31.840><c> just</c><00:03:32.000><c> saw</c><00:03:32.400><c> no</c><00:03:32.640><c> reason</c><00:03:33.040><c> for</c><00:03:33.360><c> why</c><00:03:33.599><c> i</c>

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
and so i just saw no reason for why i
 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.430 align:start position:0%
and so i just saw no reason for why i
should<00:03:33.840><c> put</c><00:03:34.080><c> any</c><00:03:34.319><c> effort</c><00:03:34.560><c> in</c><00:03:34.640><c> these</c><00:03:34.879><c> subjects</c>

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
should put any effort in these subjects
 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.470 align:start position:0%
should put any effort in these subjects
and<00:03:35.680><c> that's</c><00:03:36.000><c> why</c>

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.070 align:start position:0%
and that's why
i<00:03:36.640><c> didn't</c><00:03:36.879><c> do</c><00:03:37.040><c> it</c><00:03:37.440><c> would</c><00:03:37.599><c> you</c><00:03:37.760><c> like</c><00:03:37.840><c> to</c><00:03:37.920><c> do</c>

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 align:start position:0%
great I think there are better options
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.290 align:start position:0%
great I think there are better options
out<00:00:45.329><c> there</c><00:00:45.570><c> for</c><00:00:45.600><c> less</c><00:00:46.020><c> money</c><00:00:46.230><c> so</c><00:00:47.100><c> yeah</c><00:00:47.700><c> well</c><00:00:48.000><c> I</c>

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
out there for less money so yeah well I
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.330 align:start position:0%
out there for less money so yeah well I
got<00:00:48.660><c> it</c><00:00:48.780><c> and</c><00:00:48.960><c> I</c><00:00:49.170><c> don't</c><00:00:49.230><c> really</c><00:00:49.860><c> like</c><00:00:50.160><c> it</c><00:00:50.309><c> that</c>

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
got it and I don't really like it that
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.630 align:start position:0%
got it and I don't really like it that
much

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
much
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.010 align:start position:0%
much
and<00:00:50.879><c> to</c><00:00:51.090><c> be</c><00:00:51.180><c> honest</c><00:00:51.449><c> I</c><00:00:51.539><c> actually</c><00:00:51.660><c> stopped</c>

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
and to be honest I actually stopped
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.350 align:start position:0%
and to be honest I actually stopped
taking<00:00:52.289><c> it</c><00:00:52.500><c> off</c><00:00:52.649><c> and</c><00:00:52.800><c> just</c><00:00:53.489><c> using</c><00:00:53.940><c> this</c><00:00:54.090><c> case</c>

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
taking it off and just using this case
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.750 align:start position:0%
taking it off and just using this case
so<00:00:54.840><c> you</c><00:00:54.930><c> can</c><00:00:55.140><c> just</c><00:00:55.289><c> slip</c><00:00:55.860><c> your</c><00:00:55.920><c> iPad</c><00:00:56.309><c> in</c><00:00:56.489><c> and</c>

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
so you can just slip your iPad in and
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.729 align:start position:0%
so you can just slip your iPad in and
then<00:00:57.030><c> you</c><00:00:57.210><c> can</c><00:00:57.390><c> put</c><00:00:57.570><c> your</c><00:00:57.600><c> Apple</c><00:00:58.020><c> pencil</c><00:00:58.199><c> and</c>

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
then you can put your Apple pencil and
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
then you can put your Apple pencil and
up<00:00:58.980><c> here</c><00:00:59.280><c> and</c><00:00:59.489><c> I</c><00:01:00.180><c> found</c><00:01:00.449><c> that</c><00:01:00.570><c> more</c><00:01:00.870><c> useful</c>

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 align:start position:0%
up here and I found that more useful
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
up here and I found that more useful
because<00:01:01.469><c> I</c><00:01:01.680><c> just</c><00:01:01.859><c> really</c><00:01:02.190><c> don't</c><00:01:02.399><c> need</c><00:01:02.609><c> to</c>

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
and then I take all my readings and I

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 align:start position:0%
always put the word reading before it so
 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
always put the word reading before it so
that<00:02:33.080><c> they</c><00:02:33.230><c> all</c><00:02:33.410><c> get</c><00:02:33.680><c> put</c><00:02:33.830><c> together</c><00:02:33.980><c> because</c>

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 align:start position:0%
that they all get put together because

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 align:start position:0%
because one lecture just make you write
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.420 align:start position:0%
because one lecture just make you write

down a lot of things and I thought it

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 align:start position:0%
was faster to use my laptop but that was
 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.350 align:start position:0%
was faster to use my laptop but that was

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
the only exception so that's for example
 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
the only exception so that's for example
take<00:03:17.480><c> this</c><00:03:17.570><c> lecture</c><00:03:17.870><c> handout</c><00:03:18.170><c> on</c><00:03:18.440><c> homicide</c>

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 align:start position:0%
take this lecture handout on homicide
 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.090 align:start position:0%
take this lecture handout on homicide
now<00:03:19.900><c> usually</c><00:03:20.900><c> our</c><00:03:21.140><c> lecture</c><00:03:21.440><c> handouts</c><00:03:21.769><c> aren't</c>

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 align:start position:0%
now usually our lecture handouts aren't
 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.550 align:start position:0%
now usually our lecture handouts aren't

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
as spaced out as this one so I usually
 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.530 align:start position:0%
as spaced out as this one so I usually
add<00:03:24.860><c> spaces</c><00:03:25.459><c> like</c><00:03:25.580><c> especially</c><00:03:25.850><c> here</c><00:03:26.330><c> between</c>

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 align:start position:0%
add spaces like especially here between
 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
add spaces like especially here between
cases<00:03:27.230><c> because</c><00:03:27.800><c> then</c><00:03:27.950><c> I</c><00:03:28.010><c> can</c><00:03:28.190><c> just</c><00:03:28.220><c> write</c><00:03:28.580><c> down</c>

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 align:start position:0%
cases because then I can just write down
 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.759 align:start position:0%
cases because then I can just write down

more about the facts of the case so what
 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
more about the facts of the case so what

just add spaces to it in word find this
 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
just add spaces to it in word find this

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
used a lot of colors I used purple I
 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
used a lot of colors I used purple I
used<00:05:30.450><c> some</c><00:05:31.080><c> darker</c><00:05:31.530><c> red</c><00:05:31.770><c> and</c><00:05:32.100><c> even</c><00:05:32.640><c> some</c><00:05:32.820><c> green</c>

used some darker red and even some green
 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.850 align:start position:0%
used some darker red and even some green
and<00:05:33.390><c> that's</c><00:05:33.510><c> done</c><00:05:33.780><c> often</c><00:05:33.960><c> because</c><00:05:34.440><c> I</c><00:05:34.680><c> just</c>

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
and that's done often because I just
 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
and that's done often because I just
don't<00:05:35.190><c> have</c><00:05:35.910><c> enough</c><00:05:36.030><c> space</c><00:05:36.180><c> to</c><00:05:36.570><c> only</c><00:05:36.780><c> work</c>

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 align:start position:0%
don't have enough space to only work
 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.780 align:start position:0%
don't have enough space to only work
with<00:05:37.230><c> my</c><00:05:37.350><c> gray</c><00:05:37.650><c> because</c><00:05:38.160><c> it</c><00:05:38.370><c> would</c><00:05:38.490><c> just</c><00:05:38.520><c> get</c>

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 align:start position:0%
with my gray because it would just get
 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.730 align:start position:0%
with my gray because it would just get
really<00:05:39.060><c> messy</c><00:05:39.510><c> so</c><00:05:40.140><c> then</c><00:05:40.260><c> I</c><00:05:40.350><c> like</c><00:05:40.470><c> to</c><00:05:40.620><c> use</c>

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
really messy so then I like to use
 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.650 align:start position:0%

a little bit different because usually I

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
just highlight and that's pretty much it
 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.610 align:start position:0%
just highlight and that's pretty much it
now<00:07:23.939><c> visit</c><00:07:24.449><c> for</c><00:07:24.569><c> example</c><00:07:24.839><c> a</c><00:07:24.870><c> case</c><00:07:25.080><c> and</c><00:07:25.409><c> here</c>

now visit for example a case and here

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:36.990 align:start position:0%
that's about it like sometimes I do make
 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
that's about it like sometimes I do make

that's it

I<00:08:19.409><c> just</c><00:08:19.680><c> download</c><00:08:20.490><c> the</c><00:08:20.580><c> entire</c><00:08:20.789><c> thing</c><00:08:21.089><c> and</c>

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
I just download the entire thing and
 

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.110 align:start position:0%
I just download the entire thing and
then<00:08:21.479><c> for</c><00:08:21.719><c> example</c><00:08:21.809><c> here</c><00:08:22.319><c> I</c><00:08:22.620><c> just</c><00:08:23.580><c> go</c><00:08:23.699><c> in</c><00:08:23.849><c> and</c>

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
then for example here I just go in and
 

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.929 align:start position:0%
then for example here I just go in and
look<00:08:24.629><c> at</c><00:08:24.719><c> the</c><00:08:25.039><c> overview</c><00:08:26.039><c> things</c><00:08:26.430><c> and</c><00:08:26.639><c> then</c><00:08:26.759><c> I</c>

00:08:26.929 --> 00:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
look at the overview things and then I
 

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:31.010 align:start position:0%
look at the overview things and then I
make<00:08:27.719><c> a</c><00:08:27.990><c> gray</c><00:08:28.409><c> tick</c><00:08:29.189><c> when</c><00:08:29.729><c> I</c><00:08:29.969><c> have</c><00:08:30.360><c> to</c><00:08:30.629><c> reading</c>

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
make a gray tick when I have to reading
 

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
make a gray tick when I have to reading

00:08:33.199 --> 00:08:33.209 align:start position:0%

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
then what I do is I just highlight with

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
lectures don't have slides so I can't do
 

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.500 align:start position:0%
lectures don't have slides so I can't do
it<00:10:21.800><c> anyway</c><00:10:22.100><c> but</c><00:10:22.610><c> if</c><00:10:22.700><c> they</c><00:10:22.850><c> do</c><00:10:22.910><c> have</c><00:10:23.270><c> slides</c>

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:23.510 align:start position:0%
it anyway but if they do have slides
 

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.900 align:start position:0%
it anyway but if they do have slides
then<00:10:23.839><c> I</c><00:10:23.870><c> do</c><00:10:24.080><c> like</c><00:10:24.410><c> to</c><00:10:24.589><c> use</c><00:10:24.650><c> them</c><00:10:24.980><c> if</c><00:10:25.250><c> they</c><00:10:25.640><c> are</c>

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
then I do like to use them if they are
 

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.370 align:start position:0%
then I do like to use them if they are
more<00:10:26.240><c> comprehensive</c><00:10:26.870><c> than</c><00:10:27.110><c> the</c><00:10:27.230><c> lecture</c>

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:27.380 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive than the lecture
 

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.260 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive than the lecture
handout<00:10:27.830><c> and</c><00:10:28.070><c> then</c><00:10:28.490><c> I</c><00:10:28.520><c> basically</c><00:10:28.880><c> just</c><00:10:29.000><c> treat</c>

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:29.270 align:start position:0%
handout and then I basically just treat
 

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.970 align:start position:0%
handout and then I basically just treat
it<00:10:29.390><c> like</c><00:10:29.660><c> a</c><00:10:29.690><c> lecture</c><00:10:29.870><c> handout</c><00:10:30.290><c> and</c><00:10:30.710><c> you</c><00:10:30.830><c> can</c>

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:30.980 align:start position:0%
it like a lecture handout and you can
 

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.940 align:start position:0%
it like a lecture handout and you can
see<00:10:31.100><c> I</c><00:10:31.130><c> also</c><00:10:31.370><c> use</c><00:10:31.580><c> green</c><00:10:31.910><c> for</c><00:10:32.950><c> legislation</c>

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:33.950 align:start position:0%
see I also use green for legislation
 

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.980 align:start position:0%
see I also use green for legislation
because<00:10:34.640><c> we</c><00:10:34.880><c> don't</c><00:10:35.120><c> talk</c><00:10:35.510><c> a</c><00:10:35.540><c> lot</c><00:10:35.959><c> about</c>

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
because we don't talk a lot about
 

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.130 align:start position:0%
because we don't talk a lot about
different<00:10:36.230><c> legislations</c><00:10:37.070><c> it's</c><00:10:37.220><c> mostly</c><00:10:37.550><c> cases</c>

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:38.140 align:start position:0%
different legislations it's mostly cases
 

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.820 align:start position:0%
different legislations it's mostly cases
and<00:10:39.400><c> since</c><00:10:40.400><c> we</c><00:10:40.520><c> use</c><00:10:40.700><c> the</c><00:10:40.850><c> cases</c><00:10:41.240><c> for</c><00:10:41.830><c> the</c>

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:42.830 align:start position:0%
and since we use the cases for the

and since we use the cases for the

different rules that were established in
them

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
them
 

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.449 align:start position:0%
them
I<00:10:44.750><c> find</c><00:10:45.260><c> it</c><00:10:45.320><c> appropriate</c><00:10:45.500><c> to</c><00:10:45.830><c> also</c><00:10:46.220><c> use</c><00:10:46.339><c> the</c>

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:46.459 align:start position:0%
I find it appropriate to also use the
 

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:49.870 align:start position:0%
I find it appropriate to also use the
green<00:10:46.670><c> for</c><00:10:47.240><c> legislation</c><00:10:47.900><c> and</c><00:10:48.580><c> you</c><00:10:49.580><c> can</c><00:10:49.730><c> see</c>

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
green for legislation and you can see
 

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.790 align:start position:0%
green for legislation and you can see
here<00:10:50.180><c> it's</c><00:10:50.330><c> really</c><00:10:50.630><c> the</c><00:10:50.870><c> same</c><00:10:51.110><c> way</c><00:10:51.500><c> of</c>

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
here it's really the same way of
 

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.500 align:start position:0%
here it's really the same way of
organizing<00:10:52.550><c> the</c><00:10:52.640><c> know</c><00:10:52.760><c> it's</c><00:10:52.910><c> the</c><00:10:53.029><c> same</c><00:10:53.270><c> color</c>

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
organizing the know it's the same color
 

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
organizing the know it's the same color
coding<00:10:53.779><c> and</c><00:10:54.080><c> here</c><00:10:54.529><c> again</c><00:10:54.770><c> when</c><00:10:55.220><c> I</c><00:10:55.250><c> don't</c><00:10:55.940><c> think</c>

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:56.209 align:start position:0%
coding and here again when I don't think
 

00:10:56.209 --> 00:10:58.180 align:start position:0%
coding and here again when I don't think
it's<00:10:56.420><c> enough</c><00:10:56.630><c> to</c><00:10:56.750><c> just</c><00:10:56.930><c> use</c><00:10:57.080><c> grey</c><00:10:57.320><c> then</c><00:10:57.950><c> here</c><00:10:58.160><c> I</c>

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.190 align:start position:0%
it's enough to just use grey then here I
 

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.949 align:start position:0%
it's enough to just use grey then here I
had<00:10:58.430><c> free</c><00:10:58.670><c> colors</c><00:10:59.000><c> just</c><00:10:59.600><c> to</c><00:10:59.660><c> make</c><00:10:59.780><c> it</c><00:10:59.900><c> more</c>

00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
had free colors just to make it more
 

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:01.510 align:start position:0%
had free colors just to make it more
easier<00:11:00.290><c> for</c><00:11:00.440><c> me</c><00:11:00.530><c> to</c><00:11:00.560><c> see</c><00:11:00.770><c> what</c><00:11:01.100><c> I</c><00:11:01.130><c> was</c><00:11:01.250><c> doing</c>

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
easier for me to see what I was doing
 

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.910 align:start position:0%
easier for me to see what I was doing
and<00:11:01.670><c> that's</c><00:11:02.000><c> just</c><00:11:02.150><c> how</c><00:11:02.270><c> I</c><00:11:02.300><c> treat</c><00:11:02.660><c> slides</c><00:11:03.589><c> when</c>

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that's just how I treat slides when
 

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.450 align:start position:0%
and that's just how I treat slides when
I<00:11:03.950><c> used</c>

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:04.460 align:start position:0%
I used
 

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
I used
I<00:11:04.520><c> don't</c><00:11:05.330><c> use</c><00:11:05.780><c> them</c><00:11:05.960><c> a</c><00:11:06.020><c> lot</c><00:11:06.200><c> because</c><00:11:06.410><c> I</c><00:11:06.560><c> just</c>

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:06.770 align:start position:0%
I don't use them a lot because I just
 

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.380 align:start position:0%
I don't use them a lot because I just
find<00:11:06.980><c> it</c><00:11:07.130><c> the</c><00:11:07.280><c> less</c><00:11:07.460><c> easy</c><00:11:07.730><c> go</c><00:11:07.940><c> through</c><00:11:08.210><c> them</c>

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:08.390 align:start position:0%
find it the less easy go through them
 

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.330 align:start position:0%
find it the less easy go through them
again<00:11:08.720><c> but</c><00:11:09.290><c> I</c><00:11:09.350><c> do</c><00:11:09.500><c> find</c><00:11:09.830><c> it</c><00:11:09.920><c> something</c><00:11:10.160><c> is</c><00:11:10.220><c> more</c>

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:10.340 align:start position:0%
again but I do find it something is more
 

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.220 align:start position:0%
again but I do find it something is more

for<00:00:46.260><c> a</c><00:00:46.290><c> few</c><00:00:46.500><c> hours</c><00:00:46.530><c> and</c><00:00:47.130><c> it</c><00:00:47.940><c> was</c><00:00:48.090><c> honestly</c>

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
for a few hours and it was honestly
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.510 align:start position:0%
for a few hours and it was honestly
really<00:00:48.480><c> hard</c><00:00:48.930><c> to</c><00:00:49.350><c> get</c><00:00:49.470><c> permission</c><00:00:49.800><c> to</c><00:00:49.950><c> film</c><00:00:50.309><c> in</c>

there<00:00:50.730><c> but</c><00:00:51.210><c> I</c><00:00:51.450><c> think</c><00:00:51.900><c> it</c><00:00:51.989><c> was</c><00:00:52.050><c> worth</c><00:00:52.260><c> it</c>

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
there but I think it was worth it
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
there but I think it was worth it
because<00:00:52.770><c> it's</c><00:00:52.920><c> a</c><00:00:53.040><c> really</c><00:00:53.280><c> really</c><00:00:53.489><c> pretty</c>

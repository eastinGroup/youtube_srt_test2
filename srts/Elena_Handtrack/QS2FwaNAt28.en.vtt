things that really stood out um so yeah
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
things that really stood out um so yeah
without<00:00:24.660><c> further</c><00:00:24.810><c> ado</c><00:00:25.170><c> let's</c><00:00:25.590><c> get</c><00:00:25.680><c> into</c><00:00:25.740><c> it</c>

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 align:start position:0%
without further ado let's get into it
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
without further ado let's get into it
and<00:00:26.130><c> the</c><00:00:26.250><c> first</c><00:00:26.490><c> thing</c><00:00:26.760><c> is</c><00:00:27.060><c> I</c><00:00:27.240><c> think</c><00:00:27.300><c> the</c><00:00:27.449><c> most</c>

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 align:start position:0%
and the first thing is I think the most
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.179 align:start position:0%
and the first thing is I think the most
obvious<00:00:27.779><c> thing</c><00:00:28.140><c> and</c><00:00:28.230><c> those</c><00:00:28.650><c> were</c><00:00:28.800><c> my</c><00:00:28.920><c> grades</c>

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 align:start position:0%
obvious thing and those were my grades
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.250 align:start position:0%
obvious thing and those were my grades
so<00:00:29.789><c> I</c><00:00:29.820><c> actually</c><00:00:29.970><c> went</c><00:00:30.240><c> back</c><00:00:30.539><c> and</c><00:00:30.810><c> got</c><00:00:30.960><c> my</c>

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
so I actually went back and got my
 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.819 align:start position:0%
so I actually went back and got my
transcripts<00:00:31.769><c> and</c><00:00:32.090><c> I</c><00:00:33.090><c> applied</c><00:00:33.600><c> to</c><00:00:34.170><c> use</c><00:00:34.320><c> iam</c>

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 align:start position:0%
transcripts and I applied to use iam
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.010 align:start position:0%
transcripts and I applied to use iam
when<00:00:35.520><c> I</c><00:00:35.579><c> was</c><00:00:35.910><c> already</c><00:00:36.090><c> in</c><00:00:36.270><c> tenth</c><00:00:36.540><c> grade</c><00:00:36.690><c> but</c><00:00:36.989><c> I</c>

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
when I was already in tenth grade but I
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 align:start position:0%
when I was already in tenth grade but I
hadn't<00:00:37.350><c> completed</c><00:00:37.680><c> tenth</c><00:00:37.950><c> grade</c><00:00:38.190><c> so</c><00:00:38.399><c> I</c><00:00:38.460><c> apply</c>

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 align:start position:0%
hadn't completed tenth grade so I apply
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.430 align:start position:0%
hadn't completed tenth grade so I apply
it<00:00:38.879><c> with</c><00:00:39.030><c> my</c><00:00:39.149><c> ninth</c><00:00:39.629><c> grade</c><00:00:40.100><c> grades</c><00:00:41.100><c> and</c><00:00:41.520><c> I</c>

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
actually calculated my average to give
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 align:start position:0%
actually calculated my average to give
you<00:00:45.300><c> guys</c><00:00:45.420><c> an</c><00:00:45.600><c> idea</c><00:00:45.660><c> of</c><00:00:46.200><c> where</c><00:00:46.829><c> I</c><00:00:46.860><c> was</c><00:00:47.219><c> it's</c>

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
you guys an idea of where I was it's
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.569 align:start position:0%
you guys an idea of where I was it's
time<00:00:47.789><c> so</c><00:00:48.510><c> in</c><00:00:48.660><c> Germany</c><00:00:48.840><c> we</c><00:00:49.379><c> are</c><00:00:49.410><c> graded</c><00:00:49.950><c> on</c><00:00:50.160><c> a</c>

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
time so in Germany we are graded on a
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.490 align:start position:0%
time so in Germany we are graded on a
scale<00:00:50.670><c> from</c><00:00:50.910><c> one</c><00:00:51.329><c> to</c><00:00:51.360><c> six</c><00:00:51.840><c> or</c><00:00:52.050><c> six</c><00:00:52.289><c> being</c>

scale from one to six or six being
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.549 align:start position:0%
scale from one to six or six being
divorced<00:00:52.770><c> and</c><00:00:53.039><c> one</c><00:00:53.579><c> being</c><00:00:53.879><c> the</c><00:00:54.000><c> best</c><00:00:54.149><c> and</c><00:00:54.570><c> I</c>

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
divorced and one being the best and I
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.580 align:start position:0%
divorced and one being the best and I
had<00:00:55.920><c> an</c><00:00:56.160><c> average</c><00:00:56.699><c> of</c><00:00:57.149><c> one</c><00:00:57.570><c> point</c><00:00:57.780><c> zero</c><00:00:57.960><c> seven</c>

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 align:start position:0%
had an average of one point zero seven
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.029 align:start position:0%
had an average of one point zero seven
that<00:00:59.399><c> means</c><00:00:59.670><c> I</c><00:00:59.910><c> had</c><00:01:00.120><c> one</c><00:01:00.660><c> two</c><00:01:00.930><c> and</c><00:01:01.320><c> only</c><00:01:01.920><c> over</c>

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 align:start position:0%
that means I had one two and only over
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.250 align:start position:0%
that means I had one two and only over
two<00:01:02.219><c> ones</c><00:01:02.460><c> and</c><00:01:02.730><c> that's</c><00:01:02.850><c> who</c><00:01:03.059><c> was</c><00:01:03.239><c> peed</c><00:01:03.510><c> because</c>

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
two ones and that's who was peed because
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 align:start position:0%
two ones and that's who was peed because
there<00:01:04.409><c> really</c><00:01:04.439><c> suck</c><00:01:05.040><c> at</c><00:01:05.070><c> sports</c><00:01:05.400><c> but</c><00:01:05.790><c> I</c><00:01:06.270><c> don't</c>

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 align:start position:0%
there really suck at sports but I don't
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.760 align:start position:0%

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 align:start position:0%
think that this is a requirement for
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.140 align:start position:0%
think that this is a requirement for
getting<00:01:08.040><c> into</c><00:01:08.159><c> UDC</c><00:01:08.549><c> I</c><00:01:08.640><c> think</c><00:01:08.850><c> if</c><00:01:08.939><c> you</c><00:01:09.030><c> have</c>

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 align:start position:0%
getting into UDC I think if you have
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.300 align:start position:0%
getting into UDC I think if you have
anything<00:01:09.600><c> like</c><00:01:09.869><c> one</c><00:01:10.229><c> point</c><00:01:10.500><c> something</c><00:01:10.710><c> you're</c>

anything like one point something you're
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
anything like one point something you're
doing<00:01:11.670><c> pretty</c><00:01:12.270><c> good</c><00:01:12.799><c> so</c><00:01:13.799><c> don't</c><00:01:13.890><c> worry</c><00:01:14.100><c> that</c>

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 align:start position:0%
doing pretty good so don't worry that
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 align:start position:0%
doing pretty good so don't worry that
makes<00:01:14.700><c> you</c><00:01:14.850><c> already</c><00:01:14.970><c> a</c><00:01:15.390><c> strong</c><00:01:15.689><c> candidate</c><00:01:16.140><c> but</c>

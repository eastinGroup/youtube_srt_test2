00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
you just don't remember it and I think
 

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.030 align:start position:0%
you just don't remember it and I think
this<00:11:24.750><c> was</c><00:11:24.870><c> so</c><00:11:24.990><c> much</c><00:11:25.020><c> easier</c><00:11:25.290><c> way</c><00:11:25.680><c> of</c><00:11:25.860><c> like</c>

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
this was so much easier way of like
 

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.460 align:start position:0%
this was so much easier way of like
revising<00:11:26.520><c> the</c><00:11:26.610><c> content</c><00:11:27.000><c> for</c><00:11:27.150><c> supervision</c><00:11:27.810><c> so</c>

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.470 align:start position:0%
revising the content for supervision so
 

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.020 align:start position:0%
revising the content for supervision so
that's<00:11:28.740><c> why</c><00:11:28.860><c> I</c><00:11:28.920><c> like</c><00:11:29.130><c> to</c><00:11:29.160><c> do</c><00:11:29.310><c> them</c><00:11:29.430><c> on</c><00:11:29.670><c> the</c><00:11:29.910><c> day</c>

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.030 align:start position:0%
that's why I like to do them on the day

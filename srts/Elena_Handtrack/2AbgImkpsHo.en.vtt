really make history a priority I think
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 align:start position:0%
really make history a priority I think
this<00:01:33.119><c> is</c><00:01:33.240><c> really</c><00:01:33.509><c> really</c><00:01:33.869><c> important</c><00:01:34.439><c> and</c><00:01:34.619><c> a</c>

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 align:start position:0%
this is really really important and a
 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.380 align:start position:0%
this is really really important and a
lot<00:01:35.130><c> of</c><00:01:35.159><c> people</c><00:01:35.430><c> actually</c><00:01:35.549><c> forget</c><00:01:35.970><c> about</c><00:01:36.119><c> that</c>

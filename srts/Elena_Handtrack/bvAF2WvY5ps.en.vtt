moving<00:01:40.079><c> to</c><00:01:40.159><c> university</c><00:01:40.799><c> because</c><00:01:41.040><c> it</c><00:01:41.119><c> pretty</c>

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
moving to university because it pretty
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.030 align:start position:0%
moving to university because it pretty
much<00:01:41.520><c> contains</c><00:01:42.000><c> all</c><00:01:42.159><c> the</c><00:01:42.320><c> basics</c><00:01:42.799><c> and</c><00:01:42.880><c> you</c>

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
much contains all the basics and you
 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.630 align:start position:0%
much contains all the basics and you
just<00:01:43.200><c> need</c><00:01:43.360><c> to</c><00:01:43.439><c> adjust</c><00:01:43.840><c> of</c><00:01:44.000><c> how</c><00:01:44.159><c> much</c><00:01:44.320><c> you</c><00:01:44.399><c> take</c>

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
just need to adjust of how much you take
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.910 align:start position:0%
just need to adjust of how much you take
from<00:01:44.799><c> different</c><00:01:45.119><c> things</c>

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
from different things
 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.830 align:start position:0%
from different things
so<00:01:46.159><c> i</c><00:01:46.320><c> find</c><00:01:46.560><c> it</c><00:01:46.640><c> super</c><00:01:46.880><c> useful</c><00:01:47.280><c> to</c><00:01:47.360><c> just</c><00:01:47.600><c> have</c><00:01:47.759><c> a</c>

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
so i find it super useful to just have a
 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.190 align:start position:0%
so i find it super useful to just have a
list<00:01:48.079><c> like</c><00:01:48.320><c> that</c><00:01:48.479><c> because</c><00:01:48.720><c> then</c><00:01:48.880><c> you</c><00:01:49.040><c> never</c>

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
list like that because then you never
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.149 align:start position:0%
list like that because then you never
need<00:01:49.360><c> to</c><00:01:49.439><c> worry</c><00:01:49.680><c> about</c>

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
need to worry about
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.590 align:start position:0%
need to worry about
forgetting<00:01:50.640><c> something</c><00:01:50.960><c> important</c><00:01:51.360><c> because</c>

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
forgetting something important because
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.670 align:start position:0%
forgetting something important because
you<00:01:51.840><c> have</c><00:01:52.079><c> all</c><00:01:52.320><c> that</c><00:01:52.640><c> noted</c><00:01:52.960><c> down</c>

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
you have all that noted down
 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.590 align:start position:0%
you have all that noted down
and<00:01:53.840><c> you</c><00:01:53.920><c> know</c><00:01:54.079><c> as</c><00:01:54.240><c> the</c><00:01:54.320><c> years</c><00:01:54.640><c> go</c><00:01:54.799><c> by</c><00:01:55.280><c> you</c><00:01:55.439><c> can</c>

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
and you know as the years go by you can
 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.950 align:start position:0%
and you know as the years go by you can
add<00:01:55.840><c> things</c><00:01:56.079><c> to</c><00:01:56.159><c> the</c><00:01:56.320><c> list</c><00:01:56.560><c> so</c><00:01:56.719><c> that</c><00:01:56.799><c> you</c>

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
add things to the list so that you
 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.789 align:start position:0%
add things to the list so that you
always<00:01:57.200><c> have</c><00:01:57.439><c> everything</c><00:01:57.759><c> that</c><00:01:57.920><c> you</c><00:01:58.079><c> need</c>

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
and then i just take out all the things
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910 align:start position:0%
and then i just take out all the things
from<00:02:00.399><c> the</c><00:02:00.560><c> list</c><00:02:00.799><c> and</c><00:02:00.960><c> put</c><00:02:01.119><c> them</c><00:02:01.280><c> onto</c><00:02:01.520><c> my</c><00:02:01.680><c> bed</c>

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
from the list and put them onto my bed
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.670 align:start position:0%
from the list and put them onto my bed
because<00:02:02.159><c> then</c><00:02:02.399><c> i</c><00:02:02.479><c> can</c><00:02:02.640><c> see</c><00:02:02.799><c> how</c><00:02:02.960><c> much</c><00:02:03.200><c> i</c><00:02:03.280><c> really</c>

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
then the suitcases were pretty much
 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.189 align:start position:0%
then the suitcases were pretty much
packed<00:07:46.560><c> already</c>

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
packed already
 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.790 align:start position:0%
packed already
so<00:07:47.440><c> here</c><00:07:47.599><c> you</c><00:07:47.759><c> can</c><00:07:47.840><c> see</c><00:07:48.000><c> the</c><00:07:48.080><c> first</c><00:07:48.400><c> one</c><00:07:48.560><c> which</c>

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
so here you can see the first one which
 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.230 align:start position:0%
so here you can see the first one which
has<00:07:48.960><c> gotten</c><00:07:49.360><c> quite</c><00:07:49.680><c> full</c><00:07:49.919><c> but</c>

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.909 align:start position:0%
has gotten quite full but
i<00:07:50.400><c> think</c><00:07:50.560><c> you</c><00:07:50.720><c> could</c><00:07:50.879><c> still</c><00:07:51.280><c> stuff</c><00:07:51.599><c> a</c><00:07:51.680><c> few</c>

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
i think you could still stuff a few
 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.749 align:start position:0%
i think you could still stuff a few
things<00:07:52.160><c> in</c><00:07:52.319><c> there</c><00:07:52.960><c> and</c><00:07:53.120><c> then</c><00:07:53.280><c> the</c><00:07:53.360><c> second</c><00:07:53.599><c> one</c>

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
things in there and then the second one
 

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
things in there and then the second one
which<00:07:54.000><c> is</c><00:07:54.080><c> rather</c><00:07:54.479><c> empty</c><00:07:54.800><c> in</c><00:07:54.879><c> comparison</c>

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%

like for example my winter jacket still
 

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.470 align:start position:0%
like for example my winter jacket still
needs<00:08:49.519><c> to</c><00:08:49.680><c> go</c><00:08:49.839><c> in</c><00:08:50.000><c> there</c>

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
needs to go in there
 

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.070 align:start position:0%
needs to go in there
but<00:08:50.720><c> also</c><00:08:51.040><c> things</c><00:08:51.360><c> you</c><00:08:51.440><c> know</c><00:08:51.600><c> for</c><00:08:51.760><c> basic</c>

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
but also things you know for basic
 

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.550 align:start position:0%
but also things you know for basic
survival<00:08:53.200><c> like</c><00:08:53.760><c> cups</c>

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
survival like cups
 

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.910 align:start position:0%
survival like cups
forks<00:08:55.120><c> knives</c><00:08:55.920><c> things</c><00:08:56.240><c> like</c><00:08:56.480><c> that</c>

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
forks knives things like that
 

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.670 align:start position:0%
forks knives things like that
so<00:08:58.240><c> they</c><00:08:58.399><c> will</c><00:08:58.560><c> be</c><00:08:58.720><c> filled</c><00:08:59.040><c> and</c><00:08:59.200><c> i</c><00:08:59.360><c> think</c><00:08:59.519><c> there</c>

00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
so they will be filled and i think there
 

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.350 align:start position:0%
so they will be filled and i think there
will<00:08:59.839><c> probably</c><00:09:00.240><c> be</c><00:09:00.480><c> another</c><00:09:00.880><c> bag</c>

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
will probably be another bag
 

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.350 align:start position:0%
will probably be another bag
which<00:09:01.600><c> is</c><00:09:01.760><c> fine</c><00:09:02.000><c> because</c><00:09:02.720><c> we're</c><00:09:02.880><c> going</c><00:09:03.120><c> over</c>

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
which is fine because we're going over
 

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
which is fine because we're going over
with<00:09:03.600><c> a</c><00:09:03.680><c> car</c>

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
guys about two essentials but i think
 

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.949 align:start position:0%
guys about two essentials but i think
they<00:09:07.839><c> should</c><00:09:08.000><c> be</c><00:09:08.160><c> included</c>

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
they should be included
 

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
they should be included
just<00:09:09.200><c> in</c><00:09:09.279><c> case</c><00:09:09.519><c> anyone</c><00:09:09.760><c> uses</c><00:09:10.080><c> this</c><00:09:10.160><c> video</c><00:09:10.399><c> for</c>

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
just in case anyone uses this video for
 

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.150 align:start position:0%
just in case anyone uses this video for
reference<00:09:10.959><c> which</c><00:09:11.279><c> i</c><00:09:11.360><c> would</c><00:09:11.519><c> not</c><00:09:11.680><c> recommend</c>

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
reference which i would not recommend
 

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.110 align:start position:0%
reference which i would not recommend
because<00:09:12.399><c> you</c><00:09:12.480><c> probably</c><00:09:12.720><c> don't</c><00:09:12.880><c> need</c><00:09:13.040><c> that</c>

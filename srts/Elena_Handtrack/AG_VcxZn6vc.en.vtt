things<00:19:10.530><c> were</c><00:19:11.400><c> in</c><00:19:11.640><c> my</c><00:19:11.820><c> opinion</c><00:19:12.890><c> drawing</c>

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:13.890 align:start position:0%
things were in my opinion drawing
 

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
things were in my opinion drawing
conclusions<00:19:14.070><c> that</c><00:19:14.700><c> I</c><00:19:14.730><c> say</c><00:19:14.940><c> they</c><00:19:15.000><c> don't</c><00:19:15.180><c> draw</c>

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:17.610 align:start position:0%
conclusions but I felt like they were at
 

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.850 align:start position:0%
conclusions but I felt like they were at
some<00:19:17.760><c> stages</c><00:19:18.240><c> just</c><00:19:18.690><c> like</c><00:19:18.840><c> you</c><00:19:19.020><c> know</c><00:19:19.110><c> when</c><00:19:19.740><c> you</c>

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
some stages just like you know when you
 

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
some stages just like you know when you
cut<00:19:20.130><c> from</c><00:19:20.340><c> one</c><00:19:20.550><c> scene</c><00:19:20.820><c> to</c><00:19:20.940><c> the</c><00:19:21.030><c> next</c><00:19:21.150><c> and</c><00:19:21.720><c> like</c>

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
cut from one scene to the next and like
 

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
cut from one scene to the next and like
what<00:19:22.440><c> are</c><00:19:22.530><c> you</c><00:19:22.620><c> cutting</c><00:19:22.890><c> to</c><00:19:23.220><c> what</c><00:19:23.430><c> music</c><00:19:23.880><c> are</c>

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:23.970 align:start position:0%
what are you cutting to what music are
 

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.790 align:start position:0%
what are you cutting to what music are
you<00:19:24.180><c> using</c><00:19:24.390><c> I</c><00:19:24.810><c> don't</c><00:19:25.080><c> think</c><00:19:25.290><c> there</c><00:19:25.500><c> were</c><00:19:25.590><c> some</c>

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
you using I don't think there were some
 

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.340 align:start position:0%
you using I don't think there were some
conclusions<00:19:26.340><c> that</c><00:19:26.430><c> were</c><00:19:26.550><c> being</c><00:19:26.760><c> drawn</c><00:19:27.350><c> now</c>

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:28.350 align:start position:0%
conclusions that were being drawn now
 

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.050 align:start position:0%
conclusions that were being drawn now
they<00:19:28.500><c> just</c><00:19:28.680><c> say</c><00:19:28.770><c> it's</c><00:19:28.920><c> a</c><00:19:29.040><c> motive</c><00:19:29.340><c> so</c><00:19:29.850><c> yeah</c>

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
they just say it's a motive so yeah
 

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.150 align:start position:0%
they just say it's a motive so yeah
probably<00:19:30.570><c> that's</c><00:19:30.900><c> why</c><00:19:31.080><c> but</c><00:19:31.440><c> I</c><00:19:31.590><c> do</c><00:19:31.680><c> think</c><00:19:32.040><c> that</c>

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
probably that's why but I do think that
 

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.710 align:start position:0%
probably that's why but I do think that
they<00:19:32.370><c> are</c><00:19:32.430><c> emotive</c><00:19:32.880><c> editing</c><00:19:33.240><c> draws</c>

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
they are emotive editing draws
 

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.950 align:start position:0%
they are emotive editing draws
conclusions<00:19:33.990><c> that's</c><00:19:34.860><c> just</c><00:19:35.040><c> my</c><00:19:35.160><c> take</c><00:19:35.340><c> on</c><00:19:35.490><c> it</c><00:19:35.700><c> um</c>

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
conclusions that's just my take on it um
 

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.260 align:start position:0%
conclusions that's just my take on it um
and<00:19:36.960><c> so</c><00:19:37.590><c> yeah</c><00:19:37.890><c> I</c><00:19:38.130><c> think</c><00:19:38.460><c> you</c><00:19:38.700><c> know</c><00:19:38.790><c> they</c><00:19:39.060><c> could</c>

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:39.270 align:start position:0%
and so yeah I think you know they could
 

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.670 align:start position:0%
and so yeah I think you know they could
have<00:19:39.300><c> portrayed</c><00:19:39.660><c> this</c><00:19:39.780><c> a</c><00:19:39.990><c> bit</c><00:19:40.230><c> differently</c><00:19:40.260><c> if</c>

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
have portrayed this a bit differently if
 

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.290 align:start position:0%
have portrayed this a bit differently if
they<00:19:40.860><c> had</c><00:19:40.980><c> also</c><00:19:41.250><c> chosen</c><00:19:41.700><c> more</c><00:19:41.880><c> people</c><00:19:42.150><c> with</c>

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
they had also chosen more people with
 

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.330 align:start position:0%
they had also chosen more people with

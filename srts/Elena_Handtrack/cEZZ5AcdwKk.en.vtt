00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 align:start position:0%
didn't really use the space that well
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.380 align:start position:0%
didn't really use the space that well
because<00:01:29.159><c> for</c><00:01:29.340><c> example</c><00:01:29.460><c> here</c><00:01:29.850><c> it</c><00:01:30.000><c> goes</c><00:01:30.119><c> just</c><00:01:30.329><c> to</c>

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 align:start position:0%
because for example here it goes just to
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.780 align:start position:0%
because for example here it goes just to
put<00:01:30.840><c> a</c><00:01:30.869><c> few</c><00:01:31.079><c> more</c><00:01:31.110><c> shelves</c><00:01:31.500><c> of</c><00:01:31.619><c> drawers</c><00:01:31.829><c> but</c>

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 align:start position:0%
put a few more shelves of drawers but
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.950 align:start position:0%
put a few more shelves of drawers but
they<00:01:32.909><c> didn't</c><00:01:33.210><c> so</c><00:01:33.390><c> that's</c><00:01:33.479><c> why</c><00:01:33.659><c> I</c><00:01:33.689><c> didn't</c>

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
they didn't so that's why I didn't
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 align:start position:0%
they didn't so that's why I didn't
really<00:01:34.079><c> have</c><00:01:34.229><c> space</c><00:01:34.530><c> for</c><00:01:34.560><c> my</c><00:01:34.860><c> towels</c><00:01:35.159><c> so</c><00:01:35.850><c> I</c>

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
really have space for my towels so I

throughout<00:02:37.430><c> the</c><00:02:37.579><c> year</c><00:02:37.760><c> so</c><00:02:37.970><c> that's</c><00:02:38.090><c> great</c><00:02:38.299><c> and</c>

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 align:start position:0%

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
then up there we have a pin board and
 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.699 align:start position:0%
then up there we have a pin board and

the pin board normally looks a bit
 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.349 align:start position:0%
the pin board normally looks a bit

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 align:start position:0%

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.059 align:start position:0%

vinyl<00:02:44.720><c> over</c><00:02:45.049><c> it</c><00:02:45.170><c> so</c><00:02:45.530><c> that</c><00:02:45.560><c> it</c><00:02:45.799><c> looks</c><00:02:45.950><c> a</c><00:02:46.040><c> bit</c>

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 align:start position:0%
vinyl over it so that it looks a bit
 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.190 align:start position:0%
vinyl over it so that it looks a bit

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 align:start position:0%

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
effect that it has I actually thought
that<00:02:50.090><c> it</c><00:02:50.420><c> was</c><00:02:50.510><c> going</c><00:02:50.629><c> to</c><00:02:50.659><c> be</c><00:02:50.870><c> a</c><00:02:50.900><c> bit</c><00:02:51.109><c> lighter</c>

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be a bit lighter
 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.410 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be a bit lighter

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 align:start position:0%
put that on my other pin board so that
 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.129 align:start position:0%
put that on my other pin board so that

really really amazing I love this wing
 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.110 align:start position:0%
really really amazing I love this wing
so<00:03:06.109><c> much</c><00:03:06.319><c> and</c><00:03:06.560><c> I</c><00:03:06.859><c> just</c><00:03:07.069><c> put</c><00:03:07.220><c> it</c><00:03:07.250><c> up</c><00:03:07.370><c> using</c><00:03:07.790><c> a</c><00:03:07.879><c> pin</c>

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
so much and I just put it up using a pin
 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.879 align:start position:0%
so much and I just put it up using a pin
because<00:03:08.389><c> the</c><00:03:08.690><c> pin</c><00:03:08.870><c> board</c><00:03:09.079><c> is</c><00:03:09.200><c> very</c><00:03:09.349><c> very</c><00:03:09.620><c> thick</c>

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 align:start position:0%
because the pin board is very very thick
 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.069 align:start position:0%
because the pin board is very very thick
so<00:03:10.430><c> once</c><00:03:10.609><c> you</c><00:03:10.730><c> get</c><00:03:10.849><c> your</c><00:03:10.909><c> pin</c><00:03:11.209><c> in</c><00:03:11.389><c> there</c><00:03:11.599><c> it</c><00:03:11.840><c> can</c>

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
so once you get your pin in there it can
 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.750 align:start position:0%
so once you get your pin in there it can
hold<00:03:12.260><c> something</c><00:03:12.590><c> that</c><00:03:12.920><c> weighs</c><00:03:13.250><c> quite</c><00:03:13.489><c> a</c><00:03:13.519><c> bit</c>

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
hold something that weighs quite a bit
 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.059 align:start position:0%
hold something that weighs quite a bit
and<00:03:13.940><c> then</c><00:03:14.599><c> down</c><00:03:14.840><c> here</c><00:03:14.870><c> I</c><00:03:15.349><c> have</c><00:03:15.410><c> these</c><00:03:15.799><c> three</c>

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 align:start position:0%

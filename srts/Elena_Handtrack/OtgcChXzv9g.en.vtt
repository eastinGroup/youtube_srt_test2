more<00:02:55.610><c> convenient</c><00:02:56.090><c> to</c><00:02:56.180><c> just</c><00:02:56.239><c> carry</c><00:02:56.600><c> around</c><00:02:56.750><c> and</c>

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 align:start position:0%
more convenient to just carry around and
 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.870 align:start position:0%
more convenient to just carry around and
I<00:02:57.980><c> think</c><00:02:58.040><c> if</c><00:02:58.220><c> you</c><00:02:58.280><c> have</c><00:02:58.400><c> a</c><00:02:58.430><c> little</c><00:02:58.580><c> box</c><00:02:58.820><c> like</c>

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
I think if you have a little box like
 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.490 align:start position:0%
I think if you have a little box like
this<00:02:59.060><c> you</c><00:02:59.270><c> can</c><00:02:59.390><c> just</c><00:02:59.420><c> take</c><00:02:59.720><c> it</c><00:02:59.900><c> and</c><00:03:00.200><c> bring</c><00:03:00.380><c> it</c>

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 align:start position:0%
this you can just take it and bring it
 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500 align:start position:0%
this you can just take it and bring it
to<00:03:00.590><c> the</c><00:03:00.680><c> library</c><00:03:01.040><c> and</c><00:03:01.340><c> open</c><00:03:01.790><c> it</c><00:03:01.850><c> up</c><00:03:01.940><c> obviously</c>

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 align:start position:0%

that's<00:03:03.020><c> like</c><00:03:03.260><c> from</c><00:03:03.410><c> a</c><00:03:03.470><c> perspective</c><00:03:03.890><c> of</c>

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 align:start position:0%
that's like from a perspective of
 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.860 align:start position:0%
that's like from a perspective of

mainly<00:05:03.800><c> use</c><00:05:04.130><c> a4</c><00:05:05.090><c> sheets</c><00:05:05.330><c> for</c><00:05:05.570><c> history</c><00:05:05.870><c> because</c>

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 align:start position:0%
mainly use a4 sheets for history because
 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.670 align:start position:0%
mainly use a4 sheets for history because
history<00:05:06.920><c> is</c><00:05:07.310><c> just</c><00:05:07.460><c> a</c><00:05:07.940><c> lot</c><00:05:08.330><c> of</c><00:05:08.390><c> content</c><00:05:08.810><c> and</c><00:05:09.170><c> I</c>

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
history is just a lot of content and I
 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
history is just a lot of content and I
found<00:05:10.670><c> it</c><00:05:10.820><c> to</c><00:05:11.090><c> be</c><00:05:11.120><c> not</c><00:05:12.110><c> really</c><00:05:12.380><c> efficient</c><00:05:12.920><c> to</c>

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 align:start position:0%
found it to be not really efficient to
 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
found it to be not really efficient to

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 align:start position:0%
put it on flash cards because you just
 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.810 align:start position:0%
put it on flash cards because you just
like<00:05:15.410><c> keep</c><00:05:15.650><c> turning</c><00:05:16.010><c> the</c><00:05:16.100><c> flashcards</c><00:05:16.580><c> like</c>

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 align:start position:0%
like keep turning the flashcards like
 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.670 align:start position:0%
like keep turning the flashcards like
until<00:05:17.540><c> you</c><00:05:17.660><c> like</c><00:05:17.750><c> at</c><00:05:17.870><c> the</c><00:05:17.960><c> end</c><00:05:18.110><c> of</c><00:05:18.320><c> just</c><00:05:18.530><c> your</c>

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 align:start position:0%
studying like anything like that
 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.020 align:start position:0%
studying like anything like that
then<00:05:23.390><c> links</c><00:05:23.750><c> theories</c><00:05:24.290><c> to</c><00:05:24.650><c> your</c><00:05:24.860><c> timeline</c><00:05:25.250><c> so</c>

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 align:start position:0%
then links theories to your timeline so
 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.180 align:start position:0%
then links theories to your timeline so
that's<00:05:26.480><c> why</c><00:05:26.630><c> I</c><00:05:26.660><c> found</c><00:05:26.930><c> a</c><00:05:27.230><c> fortune</c><00:05:27.770><c> it's</c><00:05:27.890><c> much</c>

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 align:start position:0%
that's why I found a fortune it's much
 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.310 align:start position:0%
that's why I found a fortune it's much
more<00:05:28.340><c> efficient</c><00:05:28.670><c> for</c><00:05:28.730><c> history</c><00:05:29.090><c> and</c><00:05:29.810><c> I'm</c><00:05:30.200><c> also</c>

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
more efficient for history and I'm also
 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.210 align:start position:0%
more efficient for history and I'm also
going<00:05:30.470><c> to</c><00:05:30.530><c> show</c><00:05:30.620><c> you</c><00:05:30.710><c> guys</c><00:05:30.800><c> what</c><00:05:30.980><c> they</c><00:05:31.070><c> look</c>

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 align:start position:0%
going to show you guys what they look
 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.950 align:start position:0%
going to show you guys what they look
like<00:05:31.250><c> so</c><00:05:31.610><c> this</c><00:05:31.910><c> is</c><00:05:32.030><c> what</c><00:05:32.120><c> one</c><00:05:32.300><c> of</c><00:05:32.330><c> my</c><00:05:32.420><c> study</c>

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
like so this is what one of my study
 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.110 align:start position:0%
like so this is what one of my study
sheets<00:05:33.200><c> for</c><00:05:33.350><c> history</c><00:05:33.620><c> looks</c><00:05:33.800><c> like</c><00:05:34.010><c> and</c><00:05:34.220><c> so</c><00:05:35.030><c> you</c>

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
sheets for history looks like and so you
 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.450 align:start position:0%
sheets for history looks like and so you
see<00:05:35.240><c> it's</c><00:05:35.390><c> still</c><00:05:35.780><c> combined</c><00:05:36.590><c> with</c><00:05:36.830><c> flashcard</c>

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 align:start position:0%
see it's still combined with flashcard
 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.250 align:start position:0%
see it's still combined with flashcard
so<00:05:37.760><c> this</c><00:05:37.910><c> flashcard</c><00:05:38.330><c> here</c><00:05:38.510><c> is</c><00:05:38.690><c> the</c><00:05:38.870><c> timeline</c>

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 align:start position:0%
so this flashcard here is the timeline
 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
so this flashcard here is the timeline
of<00:05:39.530><c> all</c><00:05:39.710><c> the</c><00:05:39.830><c> key</c><00:05:40.010><c> events</c><00:05:40.370><c> and</c><00:05:40.670><c> it's</c>

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 align:start position:0%
of all the key events and it's

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
levels are a lot harder because you
 

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%

study<00:09:15.010><c> more</c><00:09:15.220><c> subject</c><00:09:15.700><c> it's</c><00:09:15.910><c> a</c><00:09:16.030><c> lot</c><00:09:16.180><c> more</c>

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:16.390 align:start position:0%
study more subject it's a lot more

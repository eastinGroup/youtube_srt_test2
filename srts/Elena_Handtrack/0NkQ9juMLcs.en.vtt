00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 align:start position:0%
yeah let's get into the reading
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.769 align:start position:0%
yeah let's get into the reading
technique<00:00:29.580><c> now</c><00:00:29.970><c> before</c><00:00:30.240><c> we</c><00:00:30.330><c> get</c><00:00:30.420><c> into</c><00:00:30.660><c> the</c>

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 align:start position:0%
technique now before we get into the
 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.089 align:start position:0%
technique now before we get into the
technique<00:00:31.109><c> there's</c><00:00:31.410><c> a</c><00:00:31.500><c> really</c><00:00:31.710><c> important</c>

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
technique there's a really important
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.709 align:start position:0%
technique there's a really important
distinction<00:00:32.399><c> that</c><00:00:32.669><c> we</c><00:00:32.759><c> have</c><00:00:32.910><c> to</c><00:00:33.059><c> make</c><00:00:33.210><c> there</c>

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
distinction that we have to make there
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
distinction that we have to make there
are<00:00:33.809><c> reports</c><00:00:34.230><c> of</c><00:00:34.320><c> cases</c><00:00:34.710><c> and</c><00:00:34.950><c> unreported</c>

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 align:start position:0%
are reports of cases and unreported
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.270 align:start position:0%
are reports of cases and unreported
cases<00:00:36.230><c> reported</c><00:00:37.230><c> cases</c><00:00:37.410><c> are</c><00:00:37.680><c> any</c><00:00:37.829><c> cases</c><00:00:38.040><c> that</c>

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
cases reported cases are any cases that
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.130 align:start position:0%
cases reported cases are any cases that
have<00:00:38.520><c> been</c><00:00:38.670><c> reported</c><00:00:39.000><c> in</c><00:00:39.329><c> the</c><00:00:39.450><c> door</c><00:00:39.629><c> reports</c>

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
have been reported in the door reports
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.260 align:start position:0%
have been reported in the door reports
and<00:00:40.290><c> these</c><00:00:40.500><c> cases</c><00:00:40.739><c> are</c><00:00:41.129><c> your</c><00:00:41.430><c> best</c><00:00:41.700><c> friends</c>

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 align:start position:0%
and these cases are your best friends
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.750 align:start position:0%
and these cases are your best friends
because<00:00:42.870><c> they</c><00:00:43.260><c> have</c><00:00:43.500><c> a</c><00:00:43.530><c> head</c><00:00:43.860><c> node</c><00:00:44.100><c> so</c><00:00:44.550><c> this</c><00:00:44.640><c> is</c>

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
because they have a head node so this is
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.459 align:start position:0%
because they have a head node so this is
what<00:00:44.910><c> I</c><00:00:44.940><c> had</c><00:00:45.120><c> nerd</c><00:00:45.300><c> looks</c><00:00:45.600><c> like</c><00:00:45.809><c> and</c><00:00:46.140><c> it's</c>

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 align:start position:0%
what I had nerd looks like and it's
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.139 align:start position:0%
what I had nerd looks like and it's

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 align:start position:0%
basically just a short summary I was
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
basically just a short summary I was

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 align:start position:0%
written by a little reporter and it
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.610 align:start position:0%
written by a little reporter and it
should<00:00:50.309><c> tell</c><00:00:50.520><c> you</c><00:00:50.760><c> who</c><00:00:51.239><c> the</c><00:00:51.360><c> parties</c><00:00:51.780><c> are</c><00:00:51.960><c> what</c>

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
should tell you who the parties are what
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 align:start position:0%

was the main issue at hand and what was
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.180 align:start position:0%
was the main issue at hand and what was
decided<00:00:54.989><c> now</c><00:00:55.680><c> I</c><00:00:55.710><c> think</c><00:00:55.980><c> it's</c><00:00:56.160><c> really</c>

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 align:start position:0%
decided now I think it's really
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.770 align:start position:0%
decided now I think it's really
important<00:00:56.610><c> to</c><00:00:56.670><c> keep</c><00:00:56.760><c> in</c><00:00:56.879><c> mind</c><00:00:56.940><c> Fred</c><00:00:57.360><c> knows</c><00:00:57.539><c> is</c>

that not all head nodes are created
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 align:start position:0%

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why I had notes are really
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.309 align:start position:0%
so that's why I had notes are really

really useful but don't read them as a

really useful but don't read them as a
sufficient<00:02:16.770><c> submarine</c><00:02:17.280><c> so</c><00:02:17.910><c> yeah</c><00:02:18.240><c> now</c><00:02:18.540><c> that</c><00:02:18.569><c> we</c>

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 align:start position:0%
sufficient submarine so yeah now that we
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.850 align:start position:0%
sufficient submarine so yeah now that we

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
got that distinction that was the way
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.710 align:start position:0%
got that distinction that was the way
let's<00:02:20.190><c> get</c><00:02:20.370><c> into</c><00:02:20.580><c> the</c><00:02:20.670><c> reading</c><00:02:20.940><c> technique</c><00:02:21.330><c> my</c>

the key thing about any case is its

the key thing about any case is its

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 align:start position:0%

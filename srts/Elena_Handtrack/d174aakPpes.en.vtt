00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
thing that I learned is that there's so
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.540 align:start position:0%

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 align:start position:0%
presented in the newspapers and I think
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.990 align:start position:0%

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
would read them and then I would take
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.740 align:start position:0%
would read them and then I would take
notes<00:00:20.010><c> in</c><00:00:20.250><c> them</c><00:00:20.400><c> and</c><00:00:20.640><c> then</c><00:00:21.240><c> I</c><00:00:21.330><c> would</c><00:00:21.480><c> try</c><00:00:21.630><c> to</c>

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 align:start position:0%
incorporate them in my essays and so on
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.660 align:start position:0%
incorporate them in my essays and so on
now<00:00:24.720><c> the</c><00:00:24.779><c> problem</c><00:00:25.289><c> was</c><00:00:25.439><c> that</c><00:00:25.769><c> whenever</c><00:00:26.310><c> I</c><00:00:26.400><c> had</c>

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 align:start position:0%
now the problem was that whenever I had
 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 align:start position:0%
now the problem was that whenever I had
a<00:00:26.699><c> text</c><00:00:27.000><c> that</c><00:00:27.180><c> I</c><00:00:27.210><c> had</c><00:00:27.330><c> to</c><00:00:27.480><c> read</c><00:00:27.660><c> I</c><00:00:27.930><c> would</c><00:00:28.320><c> get</c>

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
a text that I had to read I would get
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
a text that I had to read I would get
the<00:00:28.740><c> text</c><00:00:29.189><c> read</c><00:00:29.490><c> it</c><00:00:29.640><c> once</c><00:00:29.849><c> take</c><00:00:30.269><c> notes</c><00:00:30.570><c> and</c>

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 align:start position:0%
the text read it once take notes and
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
the text read it once take notes and
then<00:00:30.990><c> I</c><00:00:31.050><c> was</c><00:00:31.170><c> done</c><00:00:31.320><c> with</c><00:00:31.500><c> it</c><00:00:31.560><c> and</c><00:00:31.920><c> that</c>

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
then I was done with it and that
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.620 align:start position:0%
then I was done with it and that
technique<00:00:32.520><c> just</c><00:00:32.790><c> wasn't</c><00:00:33.210><c> really</c><00:00:33.480><c> working</c>

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 align:start position:0%
technique just wasn't really working
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720 align:start position:0%

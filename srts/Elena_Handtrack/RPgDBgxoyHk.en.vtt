00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
in both these scenarios because right
 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.499 align:start position:0%
in both these scenarios because right
now<00:07:03.710><c> you're</c><00:07:04.160><c> in</c><00:07:04.190><c> a</c><00:07:04.340><c> scenario</c><00:07:04.639><c> where</c><00:07:05.240><c> both</c><00:07:05.479><c> of</c>

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509 align:start position:0%
now you're in a scenario where both of

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 align:start position:0%
these things are still very possible and
 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.749 align:start position:0%
these things are still very possible and

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.130 align:start position:0%
why don't I read the reject letter

why don't I read the reject letter

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
conditional offer the reason is that I
 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
conditional offer the reason is that I
didn't<00:07:47.990><c> meet</c><00:07:48.139><c> my</c><00:07:48.289><c> conditional</c><00:07:48.770><c> offer</c><00:07:48.889><c> and</c><00:07:49.310><c> so</c>

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:49.849 align:start position:0%
didn't meet my conditional offer and so
 

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:51.939 align:start position:0%

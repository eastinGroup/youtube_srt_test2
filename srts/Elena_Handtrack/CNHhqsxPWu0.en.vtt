on<00:05:36.560><c> the</c><00:05:36.720><c> syllabus</c><00:05:37.199><c> here</c><00:05:37.440><c> so</c><00:05:37.600><c> i</c><00:05:37.680><c> think</c><00:05:37.840><c> it</c><00:05:37.919><c> will</c>

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
on the syllabus here so i think it will
 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.990 align:start position:0%
on the syllabus here so i think it will
be<00:05:38.160><c> quite</c><00:05:38.400><c> interesting</c><00:05:39.440><c> um</c>

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
be quite interesting um
 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
be quite interesting um
and<00:05:40.400><c> then</c><00:05:40.720><c> i'm</c><00:05:41.039><c> hopefully</c><00:05:41.520><c> also</c><00:05:41.759><c> going</c><00:05:42.000><c> to</c><00:05:42.080><c> do</c>

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
and then i'm hopefully also going to do
 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.909 align:start position:0%
and then i'm hopefully also going to do
jurisprudence<00:05:43.120><c> but</c><00:05:43.280><c> they</c><00:05:43.440><c> are</c><00:05:43.520><c> covering</c>

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%

program<00:12:32.160><c> so</c>

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
program so
 

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.949 align:start position:0%
program so
you<00:12:32.959><c> know</c><00:12:33.200><c> when</c><00:12:33.440><c> you</c><00:12:33.760><c> open</c><00:12:34.000><c> up</c><00:12:34.160><c> a</c><00:12:34.240><c> spot</c><00:12:34.800><c> at</c>

00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
you know when you open up a spot at
 

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:36.470 align:start position:0%
you know when you open up a spot at
cambridge<00:12:35.519><c> because</c><00:12:35.680><c> you</c><00:12:35.839><c> leave</c><00:12:36.000><c> for</c><00:12:36.160><c> a</c><00:12:36.240><c> year</c>

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
cambridge because you leave for a year
 

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.670 align:start position:0%
cambridge because you leave for a year
then<00:12:36.639><c> someone</c><00:12:36.959><c> from</c><00:12:37.120><c> your</c><00:12:37.279><c> partner</c>

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
then someone from your partner
 

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.430 align:start position:0%
then someone from your partner
university<00:12:38.320><c> can</c><00:12:38.480><c> fill</c><00:12:38.639><c> that</c><00:12:38.800><c> spot</c>

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
university can fill that spot
 

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.949 align:start position:0%
university can fill that spot
so<00:12:39.680><c> normally</c><00:12:40.000><c> you</c><00:12:40.160><c> can't</c><00:12:40.399><c> back</c><00:12:40.639><c> out</c><00:12:40.720><c> of</c><00:12:40.800><c> it</c>

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
so normally you can't back out of it
 

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:43.030 align:start position:0%
so normally you can't back out of it

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
later but because of kobe they also gave

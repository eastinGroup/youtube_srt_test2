really really loved my academics and I
think<00:01:47.790><c> the</c><00:01:47.880><c> teaching</c><00:01:48.090><c> is</c><00:01:48.420><c> really</c><00:01:48.869><c> really</c>

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 align:start position:0%
think the teaching is really really
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 align:start position:0%
think the teaching is really really
amazing<00:01:49.380><c> I</c><00:01:49.829><c> guess</c><00:01:50.070><c> this</c><00:01:50.220><c> is</c><00:01:50.340><c> not</c><00:01:50.490><c> a</c><00:01:50.520><c> surprise</c>

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 align:start position:0%
amazing I guess this is not a surprise
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.490 align:start position:0%
amazing I guess this is not a surprise
since<00:01:51.090><c> Cambridge</c><00:01:51.479><c> is</c><00:01:51.630><c> one</c><00:01:52.049><c> of</c><00:01:52.140><c> the</c><00:01:52.229><c> highest</c>

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
since Cambridge is one of the highest
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
since Cambridge is one of the highest

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.020 align:start position:0%

but<00:01:55.079><c> yeah</c><00:01:55.409><c> I</c><00:01:55.649><c> know</c><00:01:55.710><c> less</c><00:01:56.100><c> being</c><00:01:56.430><c> is</c><00:01:56.610><c> good</c><00:01:56.939><c> to</c>

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 align:start position:0%
but yeah I know less being is good to
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.030 align:start position:0%
but yeah I know less being is good to
say<00:01:57.180><c> that</c><00:01:57.210><c> because</c><00:01:57.479><c> I</c><00:01:57.719><c> did</c><00:01:57.869><c> say</c><00:01:58.079><c> it's</c><00:01:58.590><c> really</c>

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
say that because I did say it's really
 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.700 align:start position:0%
say that because I did say it's really
like<00:01:59.189><c> that</c><00:01:59.430><c> now</c><00:02:00.060><c> obviously</c><00:02:00.719><c> it</c><00:02:00.990><c> is</c><00:02:01.140><c> hard</c><00:02:01.409><c> and</c>

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 align:start position:0%
like that now obviously it is hard and
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.109 align:start position:0%
like that now obviously it is hard and
I'm<00:02:02.070><c> not</c><00:02:02.189><c> gonna</c><00:02:02.340><c> lie</c><00:02:02.490><c> about</c><00:02:02.520><c> that</c><00:02:02.759><c> the</c>

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna lie about that the
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna lie about that the
workload<00:02:03.600><c> is</c><00:02:03.869><c> at</c><00:02:04.350><c> times</c><00:02:04.759><c> ridiculous</c><00:02:05.759><c> and</c><00:02:06.060><c> it</c>

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 align:start position:0%
workload is at times ridiculous and it
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.219 align:start position:0%
workload is at times ridiculous and it
seems<00:02:06.420><c> a</c><00:02:06.570><c> little</c><00:02:06.780><c> bit</c><00:02:06.899><c> in</c>

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 align:start position:0%
seems a little bit in
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
seems a little bit in
to<00:02:07.710><c> put</c><00:02:07.860><c> that</c><00:02:07.979><c> on</c><00:02:08.099><c> people</c><00:02:08.250><c> but</c><00:02:09.239><c> the</c><00:02:09.750><c> thing</c><00:02:09.989><c> is</c>

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 align:start position:0%
to put that on people but the thing is
 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.890 align:start position:0%
to put that on people but the thing is
it<00:02:10.500><c> makes</c><00:02:10.920><c> you</c><00:02:11.129><c> stronger</c><00:02:11.610><c> in</c><00:02:11.819><c> the</c><00:02:12.269><c> end</c><00:02:12.450><c> and</c><00:02:12.810><c> I</c>

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
it makes you stronger in the end and I
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
it makes you stronger in the end and I
think<00:02:13.260><c> it</c><00:02:13.590><c> also</c><00:02:13.950><c> teaches</c><00:02:14.519><c> you</c><00:02:14.730><c> how</c><00:02:15.180><c> to</c><00:02:15.209><c> look</c>

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 align:start position:0%
think it also teaches you how to look
 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.210 align:start position:0%
think it also teaches you how to look
out<00:02:15.840><c> for</c><00:02:16.019><c> important</c><00:02:16.470><c> things</c><00:02:16.500><c> when</c><00:02:16.950><c> you</c><00:02:17.040><c> do</c><00:02:17.190><c> a</c>

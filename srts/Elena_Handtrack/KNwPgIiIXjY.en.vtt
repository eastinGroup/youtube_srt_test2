00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
shorter questions in future videos but I
 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.310 align:start position:0%
shorter questions in future videos but I

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 align:start position:0%
you guys the extracurriculars I do but I
 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
you guys the extracurriculars I do but I
think<00:03:36.299><c> it's</c><00:03:36.600><c> not</c><00:03:36.750><c> just</c><00:03:36.780><c> what</c><00:03:37.140><c> you</c><00:03:37.350><c> share</c><00:03:37.739><c> with</c>

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 align:start position:0%
think it's not just what you share with
 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.650 align:start position:0%
think it's not just what you share with
the<00:03:38.040><c> school</c><00:03:38.160><c> like</c><00:03:38.579><c> what</c><00:03:38.820><c> you</c><00:03:38.940><c> do</c><00:03:39.120><c> but</c><00:03:39.390><c> also</c>

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
the school like what you do but also
 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.750 align:start position:0%
the school like what you do but also
what<00:03:40.350><c> your</c><00:03:40.500><c> teachers</c><00:03:41.010><c> share</c><00:03:41.310><c> about</c><00:03:41.549><c> it</c>

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
what your teachers share about it
 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
what your teachers share about it
because<00:03:42.060><c> after</c><00:03:42.390><c> all</c><00:03:42.450><c> they're</c><00:03:42.780><c> the</c><00:03:42.900><c> ones</c>

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 align:start position:0%
because after all they're the ones
 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.259 align:start position:0%
because after all they're the ones
writing<00:03:43.290><c> your</c><00:03:43.470><c> letters</c><00:03:43.739><c> of</c><00:03:43.829><c> recommendation</c>

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 align:start position:0%
writing your letters of recommendation
 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.330 align:start position:0%
writing your letters of recommendation
so<00:03:45.269><c> I</c><00:03:45.299><c> think</c><00:03:45.690><c> there's</c><00:03:46.230><c> like</c><00:03:46.410><c> two</c><00:03:46.739><c> sides</c><00:03:47.010><c> that</c>

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
so I think there's like two sides that
 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.630 align:start position:0%
so I think there's like two sides that
kind<00:03:48.150><c> of</c><00:03:48.239><c> like</c><00:03:48.390><c> give</c><00:03:48.900><c> the</c><00:03:49.230><c> college</c><00:03:49.799><c> an</c><00:03:49.980><c> idea</c><00:03:50.340><c> of</c>

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
kind of like give the college an idea of
 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.940 align:start position:0%
kind of like give the college an idea of
how<00:03:50.970><c> active</c><00:03:51.239><c> you</c><00:03:51.600><c> are</c><00:03:51.630><c> outside</c><00:03:52.320><c> the</c><00:03:52.470><c> classroom</c>

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 align:start position:0%

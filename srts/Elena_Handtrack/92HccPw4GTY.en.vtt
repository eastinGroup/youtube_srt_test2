and<00:01:55.759><c> then</c><00:01:56.000><c> i</c><00:01:56.079><c> moved</c><00:01:56.320><c> to</c><00:01:56.479><c> cambridge</c><00:01:57.119><c> and</c>

and then i moved to cambridge and
 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.590 align:start position:0%
and then i moved to cambridge and
cambridge<00:01:57.840><c> is</c><00:01:58.000><c> significantly</c><00:01:58.719><c> less</c><00:01:59.040><c> diverse</c>

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
cambridge is significantly less diverse
 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.870 align:start position:0%
cambridge is significantly less diverse
so<00:01:59.759><c> now</c><00:01:59.920><c> my</c><00:02:00.079><c> friendship</c><00:02:00.399><c> circle</c><00:02:00.719><c> is</c>

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
so now my friendship circle is
 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.389 align:start position:0%
so now my friendship circle is
significantly<00:02:01.439><c> less</c><00:02:01.680><c> diverse</c>

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 align:start position:0%

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.389 align:start position:0%
significantly less diverse
and<00:02:02.960><c> so</c><00:02:03.200><c> i</c><00:02:03.439><c> only</c><00:02:03.680><c> learned</c><00:02:03.920><c> about</c><00:02:04.079><c> the</c>

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
and so i only learned about the
 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
and so i only learned about the
individual<00:02:04.960><c> experience</c><00:02:05.600><c> in</c><00:02:05.759><c> a</c><00:02:05.840><c> few</c><00:02:06.159><c> countries</c>

and<00:02:07.600><c> i</c><00:02:07.680><c> think</c><00:02:07.920><c> the</c><00:02:08.080><c> issue</c><00:02:08.479><c> is</c><00:02:08.640><c> that</c><00:02:08.959><c> when</c>

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%

but i also think and i also use defenses
back<00:03:39.280><c> then</c><00:03:39.680><c> that</c><00:03:39.920><c> there</c><00:03:40.159><c> are</c><00:03:40.319><c> some</c><00:03:40.640><c> opinions</c>

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
back then that there are some opinions
 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.190 align:start position:0%
back then that there are some opinions
which<00:03:41.760><c> aren't</c><00:03:42.159><c> worth</c><00:03:42.400><c> debating</c><00:03:42.799><c> which</c><00:03:42.959><c> should</c>

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
which aren't worth debating which should
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.789 align:start position:0%
which aren't worth debating which should
never<00:03:43.440><c> be</c><00:03:43.599><c> given</c><00:03:43.840><c> a</c><00:03:44.000><c> platform</c>

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
never be given a platform
 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.710 align:start position:0%
never be given a platform
so<00:03:45.360><c> there</c><00:03:45.680><c> i</c><00:03:45.760><c> would</c><00:03:46.000><c> count</c><00:03:46.239><c> things</c><00:03:46.480><c> like</c><00:03:46.560><c> for</c>

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
so there i would count things like for
 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.470 align:start position:0%
so there i would count things like for
example<00:03:47.040><c> holocaust</c><00:03:47.440><c> denial</c><00:03:48.000><c> um</c>

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
example holocaust denial um
 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.430 align:start position:0%
example holocaust denial um
no<00:03:48.959><c> you</c><00:03:49.120><c> don't</c><00:03:49.280><c> deserve</c><00:03:49.599><c> a</c><00:03:49.680><c> platform</c><00:03:50.400><c> um</c><00:03:50.799><c> so</c>

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
no you don't deserve a platform um so
 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.190 align:start position:0%

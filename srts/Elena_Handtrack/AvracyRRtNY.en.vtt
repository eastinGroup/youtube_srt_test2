00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
I do just want to say that failure is
something<00:01:08.010><c> that</c><00:01:08.159><c> is</c><00:01:08.369><c> proportional</c><00:01:08.610><c> to</c><00:01:09.119><c> how</c>

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 align:start position:0%
something that is proportional to how
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.030 align:start position:0%
something that is proportional to how
much<00:01:09.479><c> work</c><00:01:09.810><c> you</c><00:01:09.960><c> put</c><00:01:10.020><c> in</c><00:01:10.380><c> and</c><00:01:10.619><c> the</c>

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
expectations you put on yourself and I
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.230 align:start position:0%
expectations you put on yourself and I

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
think it's really important um that you
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.179 align:start position:0%
think it's really important um that you
know<00:01:15.270><c> if</c><00:01:15.509><c> you</c><00:01:15.689><c> feel</c><00:01:16.020><c> like</c><00:01:16.320><c> you</c><00:01:16.710><c> failed</c><00:01:16.920><c> at</c>

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 align:start position:0%
know if you feel like you failed at
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.070 align:start position:0%
know if you feel like you failed at
something<00:01:17.369><c> that</c><00:01:18.119><c> you</c><00:01:18.330><c> allow</c><00:01:18.540><c> yourself</c><00:01:18.930><c> to</c>

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
something that you allow yourself to

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 align:start position:0%
letting it out and I think it's really
 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
letting it out and I think it's really

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 align:start position:0%
important to do that because otherwise
 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.890 align:start position:0%
important to do that because otherwise
you<00:03:57.370><c> know</c><00:03:57.490><c> you</c><00:03:57.580><c> can't</c><00:03:58.000><c> move</c><00:03:58.300><c> on</c><00:03:58.480><c> to</c><00:03:58.690><c> the</c><00:03:58.780><c> next</c>

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 align:start position:0%

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
record all of it but I would really
 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.510 align:start position:0%
record all of it but I would really

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
recommend recording and little bit of it
 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.490 align:start position:0%
recommend recording and little bit of it
at<00:04:15.670><c> least</c><00:04:15.730><c> because</c><00:04:16.690><c> I</c><00:04:16.900><c> think</c><00:04:17.140><c> it's</c><00:04:17.260><c> really</c>

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 align:start position:0%
at least because I think it's really
 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.710 align:start position:0%
at least because I think it's really

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
in your failures because you can then

you know maybe you got rejected and then
 

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.470 align:start position:0%
you know maybe you got rejected and then
you<00:09:06.610><c> can</c><00:09:06.760><c> look</c><00:09:06.850><c> back</c><00:09:07.060><c> at</c><00:09:07.180><c> your</c><00:09:07.300><c> application</c>

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
you can look back at your application
 

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.210 align:start position:0%
you can look back at your application
and<00:09:07.870><c> be</c><00:09:07.990><c> like</c><00:09:08.140><c> okay</c><00:09:08.380><c> maybe</c><00:09:08.590><c> I</c><00:09:08.740><c> could</c><00:09:09.130><c> have</c>

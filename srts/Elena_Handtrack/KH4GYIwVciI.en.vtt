00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
together and i finished my class
 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.430 align:start position:0%
together and i finished my class
so<00:00:47.360><c> basically</c><00:00:47.920><c> i</c><00:00:48.160><c> just</c><00:00:48.320><c> took</c><00:00:48.559><c> my</c><00:00:48.719><c> notes</c><00:00:49.039><c> in</c><00:00:49.280><c> a</c>

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
so basically i just took my notes in a
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.510 align:start position:0%
so basically i just took my notes in a
blank<00:00:49.840><c> document</c><00:00:50.320><c> on</c><00:00:50.559><c> pages</c>

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
blank document on pages
 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.950 align:start position:0%
blank document on pages
and<00:00:51.680><c> that's</c><00:00:51.920><c> what</c><00:00:52.000><c> they</c><00:00:52.239><c> end</c><00:00:52.399><c> up</c><00:00:52.480><c> looking</c><00:00:52.719><c> like</c>

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what they end up looking like
 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.590 align:start position:0%
and that's what they end up looking like
then<00:00:53.440><c> normally</c><00:00:53.920><c> i</c><00:00:54.079><c> do</c><00:00:54.320><c> then</c><00:00:54.559><c> go</c><00:00:54.800><c> over</c><00:00:55.039><c> this</c><00:00:55.360><c> and</c>

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
then normally i do then go over this and
 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
then normally i do then go over this and
add<00:00:55.840><c> little</c><00:00:56.160><c> headings</c><00:00:56.559><c> here</c><00:00:56.719><c> and</c><00:00:56.800><c> there</c>

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
add little headings here and there
 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.950 align:start position:0%
add little headings here and there
but<00:00:57.760><c> the</c><00:00:57.840><c> professor</c><00:00:58.320><c> said</c><00:00:58.480><c> that</c><00:00:58.640><c> this</c><00:00:58.800><c> will</c>

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
but the professor said that this will
 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.790 align:start position:0%
but the professor said that this will
not<00:00:59.120><c> be</c><00:00:59.359><c> exam</c><00:00:59.680><c> relevant</c><00:01:00.160><c> so</c><00:01:00.320><c> i</c><00:01:00.399><c> will</c><00:01:00.559><c> probably</c>

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
not be exam relevant so i will probably
 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.869 align:start position:0%
not be exam relevant so i will probably
just<00:01:01.039><c> focus</c><00:01:01.359><c> on</c><00:01:01.440><c> the</c><00:01:01.600><c> more</c><00:01:01.840><c> exam</c><00:01:02.320><c> relevant</c>

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 align:start position:0%
just focus on the more exam relevant
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.390 align:start position:0%
just focus on the more exam relevant

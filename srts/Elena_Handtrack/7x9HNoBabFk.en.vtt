00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that with your workload
it's<00:08:54.720><c> obviously</c><00:08:55.720><c> about</c><00:08:55.870><c> getting</c><00:08:56.320><c> the</c><00:08:56.440><c> work</c>

00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:56.589 align:start position:0%
it's obviously about getting the work

it's obviously about getting the work
done

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.190 align:start position:0%
done
 

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.490 align:start position:0%

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:09.610 align:start position:0%
have a social life so the balance is
 

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.449 align:start position:0%
have a social life so the balance is
about<00:09:09.910><c> you</c><00:09:10.810><c> being</c><00:09:11.110><c> able</c><00:09:11.230><c> to</c><00:09:11.350><c> stop</c><00:09:11.709><c> and</c><00:09:11.740><c> and</c>

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:12.459 align:start position:0%
about you being able to stop and and
 

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:14.610 align:start position:0%
about you being able to stop and and
actually<00:09:12.970><c> realizing</c><00:09:13.450><c> that</c><00:09:13.540><c> you</c><00:09:13.660><c> hit</c><00:09:13.899><c> all</c><00:09:14.170><c> or</c>

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:14.620 align:start position:0%
actually realizing that you hit all or
 

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.250 align:start position:0%
actually realizing that you hit all or
that<00:09:14.980><c> you</c><00:09:15.070><c> just</c><00:09:15.220><c> need</c><00:09:15.370><c> to</c><00:09:15.430><c> have</c><00:09:15.519><c> a</c><00:09:15.550><c> break</c><00:09:15.760><c> and</c>

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
that you just need to have a break and
 

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.470 align:start position:0%
that you just need to have a break and
so<00:09:17.260><c> on</c><00:09:17.860><c> that</c><00:09:18.430><c> in</c><00:09:18.640><c> that</c><00:09:18.760><c> regard</c><00:09:18.910><c> I</c><00:09:19.180><c> think</c><00:09:19.390><c> it's</c>

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
so on that in that regard I think it's
 

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
so on that in that regard I think it's
okay<00:09:19.899><c> but</c><00:09:20.440><c> it's</c><00:09:20.589><c> also</c><00:09:20.740><c> about</c><00:09:21.390><c> being</c><00:09:22.390><c> able</c><00:09:22.600><c> to</c>

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:22.750 align:start position:0%
okay but it's also about being able to
 

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.870 align:start position:0%
okay but it's also about being able to

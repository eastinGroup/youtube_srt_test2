and you know how can they enforce it and
you<00:09:43.780><c> could</c><00:09:43.900><c> link</c><00:09:44.050><c> it</c><00:09:44.110><c> to</c><00:09:44.260><c> human</c><00:09:44.590><c> rights</c><00:09:44.800><c> so</c>

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:45.790 align:start position:0%
you could link it to human rights so
 

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.250 align:start position:0%
you could link it to human rights so
there's<00:09:45.940><c> a</c><00:09:46.060><c> lot</c><00:09:46.330><c> that</c><00:09:46.540><c> you</c><00:09:46.600><c> could</c><00:09:46.810><c> unpack</c>

there's a lot that you could unpack

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:50.140 align:start position:0%
there and but it was also very easy to

there and but it was also very easy to

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:51.550 align:start position:0%
understand because you could be like
 

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
understand because you could be like
okay<00:09:51.850><c> so</c><00:09:52.450><c> they</c><00:09:52.630><c> indicted</c><00:09:52.930><c> him</c><00:09:53.230><c> for</c><00:09:53.290><c> war</c><00:09:53.620><c> crimes</c>

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:53.650 align:start position:0%
okay so they indicted him for war crimes
 

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay so they indicted him for war crimes
first<00:09:54.100><c> then</c><00:09:54.370><c> genocide</c><00:09:54.700><c> and</c><00:09:55.240><c> yeah</c><00:09:56.200><c> then</c><00:09:56.500><c> the</c>

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:56.650 align:start position:0%
first then genocide and yeah then the
 

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.180 align:start position:0%
first then genocide and yeah then the
violence<00:09:56.980><c> shortly</c><00:09:57.640><c> decreased</c><00:09:58.090><c> and</c><00:09:58.390><c> then</c>

00:09:59.180 --> 00:09:59.190 align:start position:0%
violence shortly decreased and then
 

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
violence shortly decreased and then
everything<00:10:00.190><c> went</c><00:10:00.460><c> back</c><00:10:00.730><c> to</c><00:10:00.760><c> the</c><00:10:01.060><c> status</c><00:10:01.360><c> quo</c>

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:01.390 align:start position:0%
everything went back to the status quo
 

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
everything went back to the status quo
and<00:10:01.960><c> nothing</c><00:10:02.740><c> else</c><00:10:02.980><c> really</c><00:10:03.340><c> happened</c><00:10:04.030><c> and</c>

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.330 align:start position:0%
and nothing else really happened and
 

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.350 align:start position:0%
and nothing else really happened and
that's<00:10:04.930><c> it</c><00:10:05.200><c> and</c><00:10:05.470><c> so</c><00:10:05.530><c> that</c><00:10:06.490><c> was</c><00:10:06.610><c> really</c><00:10:06.640><c> really</c>

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
that's it and so that was really really
 

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.870 align:start position:0%
that's it and so that was really really
easy<00:10:07.510><c> to</c><00:10:07.780><c> explain</c><00:10:08.200><c> and</c><00:10:08.260><c> you</c><00:10:08.710><c> know</c><00:10:08.830><c> a</c><00:10:09.130><c> minute</c>

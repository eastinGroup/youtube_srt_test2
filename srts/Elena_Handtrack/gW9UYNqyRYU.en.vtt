00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:12.460 align:start position:0%
the practicality of it so yeah let's see
 

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.790 align:start position:0%
the practicality of it so yeah let's see
if<00:08:12.640><c> I</c><00:08:12.790><c> can</c><00:08:12.970><c> get</c><00:08:13.120><c> through</c><00:08:13.390><c> 800</c><00:08:13.930><c> pages</c><00:08:14.110><c> in</c><00:08:14.530><c> a</c><00:08:14.620><c> week</c>

if I can get through 800 pages in a week
I<00:08:15.310><c> mean</c><00:08:15.940><c> that</c><00:08:16.450><c> would</c><00:08:16.540><c> be</c><00:08:16.660><c> less</c><00:08:16.840><c> than</c><00:08:16.990><c> what</c><00:08:17.140><c> I</c>

00:08:17.159 --> 00:08:17.169 align:start position:0%
I mean that would be less than what I
 

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
I mean that would be less than what I
read<00:08:17.350><c> from</c><00:08:17.500><c> my</c><00:08:17.620><c> super</c><00:08:17.919><c> visions</c><00:08:18.250><c> but</c><00:08:18.669><c> like</c><00:08:19.390><c> for</c>

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:07.410 align:start position:0%
I just marked them in pink so it's
 

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
I just marked them in pink so it's

do like 45 minute intervals and I use
 

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.430 align:start position:0%
do like 45 minute intervals and I use
the<00:14:45.190><c> app</c><00:14:45.310><c> forest</c><00:14:45.880><c> and</c><00:14:46.090><c> I</c><00:14:46.120><c> just</c><00:14:46.330><c> you</c><00:14:46.390><c> know</c><00:14:46.450><c> put</c>

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
the app forest and I just you know put
 

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.410 align:start position:0%
the app forest and I just you know put

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:49.420 align:start position:0%
it out in 45 minutes and it grows like a
 

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.690 align:start position:0%
it out in 45 minutes and it grows like a

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:51.700 align:start position:0%
little tree in that time and then it
 

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.790 align:start position:0%
little tree in that time and then it
tells<00:14:51.850><c> you</c><00:14:52.060><c> oh</c><00:14:52.120><c> your</c><00:14:52.540><c> tree</c><00:14:52.750><c> is</c><00:14:52.900><c> grown</c><00:14:53.170><c> and</c><00:14:53.470><c> then</c>

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 align:start position:0%
pandemic and i think a lot of people are
 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.390 align:start position:0%
pandemic and i think a lot of people are
going<00:03:25.200><c> through</c><00:03:25.440><c> that</c>

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
going through that
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.589 align:start position:0%
going through that
so<00:03:26.959><c> yeah</c><00:03:27.519><c> that</c><00:03:27.760><c> one's</c><00:03:28.319><c> not</c><00:03:28.720><c> the</c><00:03:28.879><c> greatest</c>

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
so yeah that one's not the greatest
 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.070 align:start position:0%
so yeah that one's not the greatest

would probably have given me a clue
 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.589 align:start position:0%
would probably have given me a clue

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
i think the reason for that was that i

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.070 align:start position:0%
eight hours
more<00:07:21.840><c> of</c><00:07:22.080><c> time</c><00:07:22.560><c> like</c><00:07:22.880><c> distributed</c><00:07:23.599><c> across</c><00:07:23.919><c> the</c>

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
so a little bit more than an hour more
 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.790 align:start position:0%
so a little bit more than an hour more
time<00:07:27.759><c> a</c><00:07:27.919><c> day</c>

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
time a day
 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.909 align:start position:0%
time a day
um<00:07:29.759><c> which</c><00:07:30.080><c> is</c><00:07:30.319><c> honestly</c><00:07:30.800><c> great</c><00:07:31.280><c> um</c>

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
um which is honestly great um
 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.629 align:start position:0%
um which is honestly great um
but<00:07:32.160><c> i</c><00:07:32.240><c> also</c><00:07:32.479><c> don't</c><00:07:32.880><c> know</c><00:07:33.280><c> um</c><00:07:33.599><c> how</c><00:07:33.840><c> realistic</c>

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
but i also don't know um how realistic
 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.909 align:start position:0%
but i also don't know um how realistic
that<00:07:34.800><c> comparison</c><00:07:35.520><c> is</c>

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
that comparison is
 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
that comparison is
for<00:07:36.240><c> regular</c><00:07:36.639><c> law</c><00:07:36.880><c> students</c><00:07:37.199><c> because</c>

for regular law students because
 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.110 align:start position:0%
for regular law students because

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
obviously as an exchange student
 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.350 align:start position:0%
obviously as an exchange student
i<00:07:39.280><c> have</c><00:07:39.520><c> more</c><00:07:39.759><c> liberty</c><00:07:40.560><c> in</c><00:07:40.720><c> terms</c><00:07:40.960><c> of</c><00:07:41.120><c> which</c>

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
i have more liberty in terms of which
 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.950 align:start position:0%
i have more liberty in terms of which
classes<00:07:41.919><c> i</c><00:07:42.080><c> end</c><00:07:42.240><c> up</c><00:07:42.400><c> taking</c>

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
classes i end up taking
 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.550 align:start position:0%
classes i end up taking
so<00:07:43.120><c> i'm</c><00:07:43.199><c> not</c><00:07:43.360><c> really</c><00:07:43.520><c> sure</c><00:07:43.759><c> how</c><00:07:44.000><c> comparable</c>

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm not really sure how comparable
